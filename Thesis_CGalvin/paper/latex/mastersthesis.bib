abstract={In this paper, we proposed an application for video streaming on Android smartphones that can capture video from camera smartphone and then send it to the computer in realtime. On the computer, the video is played using a video player such as VideoLAN VLC. The rapid development of information cause the information exchanged is very sensitive and important, as well as the information on the video. With cryptography, information on the video can be secured by selective encryption of critical data in the video. Selective encryption only selects important part of the video which will be encrypted. H.264 video format is most used today in various multimedia applications. In selective encryption on H.264 video format, slice data on slice with type I is selected as part of the I-Frame to be encrypted. On proposed system, selective encryption process is performed on Android smartphones while selective decryption is performed on the computer. Based on the test results, the video can be selectively encrypted by selecting slice data on slice I so that video image become broken and difficult to see. However, in certain circumstances there are images on the video that are not broken or damaged even though all of slice I have been encrypted.},

abstract={The cryptographic algorithms providing unquestionable security are usually complex. From this point of view, it is reasonable that high bit rate secure live video streams require significant processing power from the end devices. To cope with the demands, there are many publications suggesting a kind of selective video encryption that reduce the burden by ciphering only a part of the video stream. As a tradeoff, the security level decreases. On the other hand, recently the retail price of the efficient hardware based cryptographic chips is dropped and devices became more and more resourceful. This is true for the mobile sector as well. In this article, based on measurements, we prove that the fully encrypted high bit rate mobile video streaming is a true possibility today, moreover there are certain scenarios where it is advised to be used. The resource barrier is no longer the processing capacity, rather the network link.},

pages={729-732}, 
abstract={Scalable video coding has long been known to provide important functionalities such as low-complexity adaptation for diverse clients with different resources and for delivery over heterogeneous networks with time-varying available bandwidths. Recent advancements in scalable video coding have significantly improved the achievable compression performance, and the scalable video coding (SVC) standard is currently under intense development. An additional capability of scalable coding, which we believe has received less attention than it deserves, is the possibility with careful cross-layer design to support secure adaptive streaming at an untrustworthy sender and secure adaptation at an untrustworthy mid-network node. Building on the secure scalable streaming framework for video, and its realization within the JPEG-2000 security (JPSEC) standard, we describe the architectural principles and design details necessary so that SVC can also enable secure adaptive streaming at a sender and secure R-D optimized adaptation at an untrustworthy mid-network node},

We study the problem of secure and efficient video streaming over an IEEE 802.11e based wireless network and also address the issues concerning digital rights management (DRM). The importance of fine granularity scalability -moving picture experts group -4 (FGS-MPEG-4), a form of scalable video format, is discussed and its characteristics are exploited for efficient and secure video streaming. We have evaluated our proposed technique via NS2 based simulations and found that keeping the base layer encrypted and giving it a higher priority do not only fulfill the requirements of the DRM, but also help improve the overall quality of service (QoS). These findings are significant because they give the content providers a high level of security and also enhance the viewing experience of the mobile users.},

pages={1763-1766 Vol. 3}, 
abstract={Two important capabilities in media streaming are (1) adapting the media for the time-varying available network bandwidth and diverse client capabilities, and (2) protecting the security of the media. Providing both end-to-end security and adapting at a (potentially untrusted) sender or mid-network node or proxy can be solved via a framework called secure scalable streaming (SSS) which provides the ability to transcode the content without requiring decryption. In addition, this enables secure transcoding to be performed in a R-D optimized manner. The original SSS work was performed for scalably coded media. This paper examines its potential application to non-scalable media. Specifically, we examine the problems of how to scale non-scalable H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video and how to do it securely. We first show, perhaps surprisingly, (hat the importance of different P-frames in a sequence can vary by two orders of magnitude. Then we propose two approaches for securely streaming and adapting encrypted H.264 video streams in an R-D optimized manner using (1) secure-media R-D hint tracks, and (2) secure scalable packets. While we can not scale the bit rate of encrypted non-scalable H.264 to the same extent possible for scalably coded media, our method does provide some scaling capability and more importantly provides 4-8 dB gain compared to conventional approaches.},

abstract={Digital fingerprinting is an emerging technology to protect multimedia content from illegal redistribution, where each distributed copy is labeled with unique identification information. In video streaming, huge amount of data have to be transmitted to a large number of users under stringent latency constraints, so the bandwidth-efficient distribution of uniquely fingerprinted copies is crucial. This paper investigates the secure multicast of anticollusion fingerprinted video in streaming applications and analyzes their performance. We first propose a general fingerprint multicast scheme that can be used with most spread spectrum embedding-based multimedia fingerprinting systems. To further improve the bandwidth efficiency, we explore the special structure of the fingerprint design and propose a joint fingerprint design and distribution scheme. From our simulations, the two proposed schemes can reduce the bandwidth requirement by 48% to 87%, depending on the number of users, the characteristics of video sequences, and the network and computation constraints. We also show that under the constraint that all colluders have the same probability of detection, the embedded fingerprints in the two schemes have approximately the same collusion resistance. Finally, we propose a fingerprint drift compensation scheme to improve the quality of the reconstructed sequences at the decoder's side without introducing extra communication overhead.},

These techniques maintain higher security levels than previously proposed selective encryption techniques while maintaining reasonable processing times. In the first of these methods, the encryption is applied to the data associated with every nth I-macroblock. In the second method, the encryption is applied to the headers of all the predicted macroblocks as well as to the data associated with every nth I-macroblock. In the third method, encryption is applied to every nth I-macroblock as well as the header of every nth predicted macroblock. The last method, with n=2, is found to be the most efficient of the three proposed methods. This method achieves a 60-82% reduction in the processing time over “total” encryption, and simulation results show that the encrypted/decoded video is fully disguised},

Though providing mobility and convenience, mobile devices generally do not offer intensive computations like their wired counterparts. In this paper we propose a set of methods that aims to protect video, specifically Motion JPEG (MJPEG) video streams, using selective data encryption. More precisely, our algorithm selects the most critical pixel information of MJPEG video as the input of encryption to keep itself lightweight while choosing and encrypting additional less-important video information when the environment allows. The proposed method was originated from the fact that JPEG images are encoded using prioritized pixel information.

abstract={The Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) service provides rich multimedia services over IP networks and is considered as a potential killer application over the Internet. The intellectual property management protocol (IPMP) system becomes important in developing this network media applications. In this paper, security function, media streaming service system and the user terminal that adopted IPMP are seamlessly integrated to provide a secured live media streaming service. In addition, the peer-to-peer (P2P) network connecting method between user terminals is also developed to provide a stable P2P IPTV system. For one incoming peer, the IPTV system would select a parent peer with low-delay and with better uplink capability than the incoming peer. It would help to maintain a stable media streaming framework. When one peer want to leave the system, it has to look for each children peer and designate a new parent peer according to above rules before updating the parent peer parameter of current one. In addition, the system can adjust the streaming bandwidth of media server to absorb the dynamic network conditions. For security control, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption is adopted in our system, in which the certificate is encrypted with the regular updated Digital Video Broadcasting-Common Scrambling Algorithm (DVBCSA) keys to prevent possible attacks. Experiments show that average bit rate and transmission delay can be maintained in good performances even when most peers are with low uplink capability.},

abstract={Emerging practical schemes indicate that algebraic mixing of different packets by means of random linear network coding can increase the throughput and robustness of streaming services over wireless networks. However, concerns with the security of wireless video, in particular when only some of the users are entitled to the highest quality, have uncovered the need for a network coding scheme capable of ensuring different levels of confidentiality under stringent complexity requirements. We show that the triple goal of hierarchical fidelity levels, robustness against wireless packet loss and efficient security can be achieved by exploiting the algebraic structure of network coding. The key idea is to limit the encryption operations to a critical set of network coding coefficients in combination with multi-resolution video coding. Our contributions include an information-theoretic security analysis of the proposed scheme, a basic system architecture for hierarchical wireless video with network coding and simulation results.},

abstract={In today's home networks security features are very rare. Infact, the only service that is usually secured is the access to the wireless network. Services, such as video streaming and audio distribution systems, often use the popular UPnP protocol since it provides dynamic service discovery and is supported by the Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA). However, UPnP implements no security features which is not only a problem for today's services, but especially for future services in future home networks. Part of the problem is the complexity and the effort that is needed for maintaining a security infrastructure and for the deployment of security mechanisms that are common in administrated enterprise networks. This paper addresses the problem stated above by introducing an assistance system that allows for the easy and almost automatic issuing and distribution of valid X.509 certificates to new devices. We then use these certificates for controlling network access and for the design and implementation of a secure video streaming system based on the Devices Profile for Web Services (DPWS). This system shows that certificates not only help within a home, but are absolutely mandatory when interconnecting multiple homes.},

title={Media-rich streaming for remote simulation and training}, 
year={2012}, 
pages={1-7}, 
abstract={We present a new approach for the real-time control and operation of media-rich workstations and simulations over remote networked computers. This approach allows a user to interact with a remote computer using a standard keyboard, mouse, and joystick at a high level of interactivity while using significantly less bandwidth than existing remote desktop applications. Existing remote desktop solutions that use no compression or single frame image compression are not able to update full-screen animation and video at an interactive rate over bandwidth constrained networks. The use of video compression allows high frame update rates with a low bandwidth usage. This allows a wide range of new media-rich telecommuting applications such as 3D graphical simulation and training. Simulation and training operations are often performed at dedicated facilities. There can be many reasons restricting these operations to a specific site, such as the use of expensive computers and the need for security to protect sensitive data used in the simulations. These geographical restrictions can have significant ramifications. Requiring training to be performed on site can both restrict the availability of such training as well as lead to high transportation and time costs and for users. By developing tools which allow remote operation of simulations, a broader deployment of training can be achieved, allowing more users to train and at a lower cost. Using video compression to stream live desktop visuals can leverage the computational facilities at simulation sites while requiring significantly less powerful computers to receive and display the video streams to end users. Furthermore, simulation data and other sensitive information can be stored on secure computers while only the visual output of the simulation is sent to the remote user. In this paper we present an implementation intended for the training of control console operators which allows remote visualization and interaction with a - imulation at HD resolution over a 1.5 Mbps T-1 data line. This allows users to train while on active deployment by using a dummy console which is able to receive and display the video stream while sending user input events back to the simulation computer. The dummy console costs significantly less than an actual simulation console and can be deployed to virtually anywhere in the world with a satisfactory internet connection. Furthermore, we demonstrate the option of using virtual and augmented reality mixed with the streamed simulation content. This allows for training when console workspaces are either unavailable or can not be taken offline from their active use. We evaluate the performance of this system on a variety of mock-simulation applications and measure that the latency of the video streaming is less than 150 ms, which includes video encoding on the host computer and decoding and display on the user's computer. The network transportation time for long distance network communication adds additional latency. Including the time for user input to be sent, we demonstrate that the total end-to-end latency for a cross country simulation is 250 ms. With this performance, interactive remote training and simulation becomes possible.},

This three-dimensional scalability offers a great flexibility that enables customizing video streams for a wide range of heterogeneous receivers and network conditions. This flexibility, however, is not supported by current stream authentication schemes in the literature. We propose an efficient and secure authentication scheme that accounts for the full scalability of video streams, and enables verification of all possible substreams that can be extracted from the original stream. In addition, we propose an algorithm for minimizing the amount of authentication information that need to be attached to streams. The proposed authentication scheme supports end-to-end authentication, in which any third-party entity involved in the content delivery process, such as stream adaptation proxies and caches, does not have to understand the authentication mechanism. Our simulation study with real video traces shows that the proposed authentication scheme is robust against packet losses, incurs low computational cost for receivers, has short delay, and adds low communication overhead. Finally, we implement the proposed authentication scheme as an open source library called svcAuth, which can be used as a transparent add-on by any multimedia streaming application.},

title={Speedup the Multi-camera Video-Surveillance System for Elder Falling Detection}, 
year={2009}, 
pages={350-355}, 
abstract={Nowadays, all countries have to face the growing populations of elders. For most elders, unpredictable falling accidents may occur at the corner of stairs or a long corridor due to body functional decay. If we delay to rescue a falling elder who is likely fainting, more serious consequent injury may happen. Traditional secure or video surveillance systems need someone to monitor a centralized screen continuously, or need an elder to wear sensors to detect accidental falling signals, which explicitly require higher costs of care staffs or cause inconvenience for an elder.In this work, we propose a human-shape-based falling detection algorithm and implement this algorithm in a multi-camera video surveillance system. The algorithm uses multiple cameras to fetch the images from different regions required to monitor. It then uses a falling-pattern recognition approach to determine if an accidental falling has occurred. If yes, the system will send short messages to someone needs to alert.In addition, we propose a multi-video-stream processing algorithm to speedup the throughput for the video surveillance system having multiple cameras. We partition the workloads of each video-surveillance streaming into four tasks: image fetch, image processing, human-shape generation, and pattern recognition. Each task will be handled by a forked thread. When the system receives multiple video streams from cameras, there are four simultaneous threads executed for different tasks. The objective of this algorithm is to exploit large thread-level-parallelism among those video-stream operations, and apply pipelining technique to execute these threads. All above algorithms have been implemented in a real-world environment for functionality proof. We also measure the system performance after multi-streaming speedup. The results show that the throughput can be improved by about 2.12 times for a four-camera surveillance system.},

abstract={The Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA) system uses end-to-end encryption in addition to the air interface encryption to provide enhanced security. End-to-end encrypted continuous data, such as video, requires synchronisation of the key stream at the receiver to the incoming encrypted data stream from the transmitter. The TETRA system uses a synchronisation technique known as frame stealing to provide synchronisation to end-to-end encrypted data. However, the frame stealing process degrades the quality of video and is not suitable for transmission of secure video. This paper proposes an alternative technique called frame insertion, which is more suitable for video. A technique known as fly wheeling is used to recover from synchronisation problems due to dropped data packets. Further, a method of reducing the synchronisation delay in a video stream is also discussed},

pages={900-905}, 
abstract={Recently, a face recognition algorithm has been proposed that has been designed to work in uncontrolled settings with non-cooperative subjects. This technique is particularly useful for access control in a tactical setting due to ease of use. The method offers secure access control while reducing the cognitive load on the warfighter so that he can concentrate on the mission. The method works with standard webcams and can be used for logon and screen lock capabilities. This method can be incorporated into a multi -factor solution where smart card and other biometric modalities can be added for enhanced security. This technology can also be applied to stand-off applications or surveillance type scenarios where the warfighter can capture a video stream from a local village and process it against a "watch list". The face recognition algorithm can recognize the individual under varying conditions that may be found in such an application such as changes in illumination, weather, facial position and expression and other degradations. One of the key features of this system is an automatic image quality and pose estimation scheme. This allows the capture of a video stream followed by automatic extraction of the key frame or frames that contain the best quality faces for recognition. This can be used to filter the video stream and transmit only the information necessary to identify the subject of interest to a central server that contains the watch list information in a secure environment. This is especially important for tactical network environments where bandwidth is at a premium and transmission of high bitrate video streams may not be feasible.},

year={2009}, 
pages={1127-1132}, 
abstract={Broadcasting of digital video signals uses large spectral area. In order to reduce the cost, broadcasters are optimizing their radio network. They build single frequency network (SFN). To maintain efficient quality of service (QoS) to the end user, accurate time synchronization and frequency syntonization is needed between transmitter sites. This function is now fulfilled with local GPS slaved clocks. In order to secure this key service, lower the cost and enable extension in GPS shaded area, an alternate source of synchronization is requested. Version 2 of IEEE 1588 protocol is promising. The application of this protocol on mixed digital voice and data metropolitan area network (MAN) infrastructure for mobile services has already proof reliability in operational backhaul network. The deployment of new services for digital video broadcast (DVB) is demanding for synchronization services that can be implemented on existing dedicated video over IP transmission network. The request is for ppb frequency accuracy and micro second time accuracy transfer. This level shall be maintained with video digitally coded stream on the same media. The variable size of DVB-TS video stream and the buffering scheme inside network switches generates milliseconds packet delay variation (PDV) that destroy the transfer performances of IEEE 1588 dedicated messages. We introduce proper end-user slave clock filtering. This filtering is applied to raw data delay measured in real broadcasting network. The results show a very efficient improvement that exceeds relative frequency accuracy level up to 1.5 times 10-10 and sub-micro second phase wander. Different stress conditions are tested and the filtering is optimized for minimum slave clock frequency source stability to optimize cost. The results are fitting broadcasting network requirements with some implementation constraint. This alternative synchronization source can secure critical synchronization service.},

abstract={Algorithmic parameterization and hardware architectures can ensure secure transmission of multimedia data in resource-constrained environments such as wireless video surveillance networks, tele-medicine frameworks for distant health care support in rural areas, and Internet video streaming. Joint multimedia compression and encryption techniques can significantly reduce the computational requirements of video processing systems. We present an approach to reduce the computational cost of multimedia encryption, while also preserving the properties of compressed video (useful for scalability, transcoding, and retrieval), which endanger loss by naive encryption. Hardware-amenable design of proposed algorithms makes them suitable for real-time embedded multimedia systems. This approach alleviates the need of additional hardware for encryption in resource constrained scenario, and can be otherwise used to augment existing encryption methods used for content delivery in Internet or other applications. In this work, we show how two compression blocks for video coding: a modified frequency transform (called as Secure Wavelet Transform or SWT) and a modified entropy coding scheme, (called Chaotic Arithmetic Coding (CAC)) can be used for video encryption. A bit sensitivity analysis for key and plaintext is presented along with experimental tests for selective encryption are given.},

In this scheme, a server segments a video into clips, and prepares the protected video by selectively encrypting the video clips off line. Proxies store the protected videos and distribute them as cable-TV programs. To decrypt a protected video or clip, a client sends to the server a request for the decryption keys. The server then generates an enabling block which enables the client to access video or clips in a period. Therefore, the present scheme enables the client to access a clip or video for a restricted number of dissemination times, but the server selectively encrypts the video only once, and the distributor performs no encryption at all.},

abstract={Secure scalable streaming (SSS) enables low-complexity, high-quality transcoding at intermediate, possibly untrusted, network nodes without compromising the end-to-end security of the system S. J. Wee, J. G. Apostolopoulos (2001). SSS encodes, encrypts, and packetizes video into secure scalable packets in a manner that allows downstream transcoders to perform transcoding operations such as bitrate reduction and spatial downsampling by simply truncating or discarding packets, and without decrypting the data. Secure scalable packets have unencrypted headers that provide hints such as optimal truncation points to downstream transcoders. Using these hints, downstream transcoders can perform near-optimal secure transcoding. This paper presents a secure scalable streaming system based on motion JPEG-2000 coding with AES or triple-DES encryption. The operational rate-distortion (R-D) performance for transcoding to various resolutions and quality levels is evaluated, and results indicate that end-to-end security and secure transcoding can be achieved with near R-D optimal performance. The average overhead is 4.5% for triple-DES encryption and 7% for AES, as compared to the original media coding rate, and only 2-2.5% overhead as compared to end-to-end encryption which does not allow secure transcoding.},

This architecture is intended as a robust platform for video surveillance systems.

To achieve this, video sources are able to discover nodes, adapt content, and transmit adapted video streams to a receiver. Our framework takes into account different issues related to the decentralized peer-to-peer paradigm such as peers' unreliability, as well as pragmatic aspects like receivers' heterogeneity. Adaptation ensures that video quality is proportional to bandwidth availability as well as the receiving devices' resources. Simulation is used to manifest that the framework is robust, reliable and suitable for multiparticipant real-time collaboration and real-life deployment.},

It starts with an analysis of the notion of Augmented Reality, that leads to the construction of a conceptual model and a definition which together capture the nature of present AR applications. This is followed by a detailed conceptual analysis of major types of Augmented Reality that contribute to an understanding of current concepts. Finally, the resulting conceptual models are applied to the newly emerging field of Augmented Reality Art in order to assess the paradigmatic potential of AR as a new artistic medium.

The key feature of the augmented reality technology is to present auxiliary information in the field of view for an individual automatically without human intervention. The effect is similar to composing computer-animated images with real scenes. To achieve the new augmented reality experience, two main problems are: How to keep track of the viewing parameters of the individual viewer? How to render a virtual image in the field of view correctly and seamlessly? To tackle the above, we are designing and implementing an enabling framework, called augmented reality computing arena for digital entertainment (ARCADE), to support the creation of augmented reality entertainment applications. Moreover, we are also developing two new video object tracking algorithms, 3D surface markers tracking and human head and face tracking.

Our proposed solution also includes adaptive rendering techniques that allow a designer to control the appearance of depth cues. We describe the results obtained from a user study considering different scenarios, which we performed for validating our approach.

It has been tested with one patient and the results have been very satisfactory. At first of the exposure session the patient was not able to approach to a real cockroach and after the exposure session using our augmented reality system, the patient was able to approach to a real cockroach, to interact with it and to kill it by herself. This first result is very encouraging and it demonstrates that augmented reality exposure is effective for the treatment of this kind of phobias.},

year={2009},
pages={49-52},
abstract={Visual delays are unavoidable in augmented reality setups and occur in different steps of the rendering pipeline. In the context of haptic interaction with virtual objects, it has been shown that delayed force feedback can alter the perception of object stiffness. We hypothesize that delays in augmented reality systems can have similar consequences. To test this, we carried out a user study to investigate the effect of visual and haptic delays on the perception of stiffness. The experiment has been performed in an optimized visuo-haptic augmented reality setup, which allows to artificially manipulate delays during visual and haptic rendering. In line with previous results, delays for haptic feedback resulted in decreased perceived stiffness. In contrast, visual delays caused an increase in perceived stiffness. However, the simultaneous occurrence of delays in both sensory channels led to a partial compensation of these effects. This could potentially help to correct stiffness perception of virtual objects in visuo-haptic augmented reality systems.},

abstract={The task of vision based people tracking is a major research problem in the context of surveillance applications or human behavior estimation, but it has had only minimal impact on (Ubiquitous) Augmented Reality applications thus far. Deploying stationary infrastructural cameras within indoor environments for the purpose of Augmented Reality could provide a users' devices with additional functionality that a small device and mobile sensors cannot provide to its user. Therefore people tracking could be expected to become an ubiquitously available infrastructural element in buildings since surveillance cameras are widely used. The use for scenarios indoors or close to buildings is obvious. We present and discuss several different ways where people tracking in real-time could influence the fields of Augmented Reality and further vision based applications.},

abstract={In this poster abstract we describe an experiment that measured depth judgments in optical see-through augmented reality at near-field distances of 34 to 50 centimeters. The experiment compared two depth judgment tasks: perceptual matching, a closed-loop task, and blind reaching, a visually open-loop task. The experiment tested each of these tasks in both a real-world environment and an augmented reality environment, and used a between-subjects design that included 40 participants. The experiment found that matching judgments were very accurate in the real world, with errors on the order of millimeters and very little variance. In contrast, matching judgments in augmented reality showed a linear trend of increasing overestimation with increasing distance, with a mean overestimation of ~1 cm. With reaching judgments participants underestimated ~4.5 cm in both augmented reality and the real world. We also discovered and solved a calibration problem that arises at near-field distances.},

abstract={As distinct from virtual reality, which seeks to immerse the user in a fully synthetic world, computer-augmented reality systems supplement sensory input with computer-generated information. The principle has, for a number of years, been employed in the head-up display systems used by military pilots and usually comprises an optical display arrangement based on part-silvered mirrors that reflect computer graphics into the eye in such a way that they appear superimposed on the real-world view. Compositing real and virtual worlds offers many new and exciting possibilities but also presents some significant challenges, particularly with respect to applications for which the real and virtual elements need to be integrated convincingly. Unfortunately, the inherent difficulties are compounded further in situations where a direct, unpixellated view of the real world is desired, since current optical systems do not allow real-virtual occlusion, nor a number of other essential visual interactions. The paper presents a generic model of augmented reality as a context for discussion, and then describes a simple but effective technique for providing a significant degree of control over the visual compositing of real and virtual worlds},

year={2012},
pages={467-471},
abstract={Thanks to an ever increasing processing power that can today support advanced graphical capabilities within high bandwidth mobile devices, augmented reality technologies are now ubiquitous, finding profitable uses in a wide variety of scenarios. Augmented reality principles, in fact, can be beneficially put to good use within many types of mobile applications: for example, augmented city guides can properly display additional virtual objects that show how a monument was at the time of its construction (e.g., the Colosseum with the inclusion of its missing parts), or augmented games can add fictitious characters and objects to real world settings in proper places (e.g., Lara Croft in search of Bartoli in Venice). Nonetheless, the totality of such augmented mobile applications, to the best of our knowledge, limit the interactions that may occur to those that can happen between a single mobile user and the objects that are displayed on his/her mobile platform screen. In this work, we show that it is possible to devise a new interaction paradigm, augmenting augmented reality apps with the interactions that may occur between multiple users via the virtual objects displayed on multiple mobile platforms. In particular, we applied such ideas to the devise of a shooting game set in the 17th century to celebrate the 300th anniversary since the foundation of the Academy of Science of Bologna by Count Luigi Ferdinando Marsili. The paper describes and discusses the design choices and the technical issues at the basis of our system.},

Flood method is a traditional therapeutic method for anxiety disorder. It is similar to system sensitivity-reducing method, but different than it is that in flood method and in the very beginning, the strongest anxiety stimulus is given so that the anxiety of the patient can reach a peak. This is to train the tolerance from the patient on the anxiety event, hence, when the patient meets slighter anxiety event, the patient won't feels that anxious. This research focuses on traditional diagnosis method of claustrophobia. It will associate virtual reality technology and game technology to develop immersion virtual reality training task, meanwhile, it will investigate if in virtual reality and augmented reality situation, people's anxiety situation can be similarly triggered.

The system proposed in this article intends to provide a friendly and intuitive interface based on Augmented Reality for heart beating evaluation and visualization. Cardiologic data is loaded from several distinct sources: simple standards of heart beating frequencies (for example situations like running or sleeping), files of heart beating signals, scanned electrocardiographs and real time data acquisition of patient's heart beating. All this data is processed to produce visualization within Augmented Reality environments. The results obtained in this research have shown that the developed system is able to simplify the understanding of concepts about heart beating and its functioning.

abstract={The ultimate goal of augmented reality is to provide the user with a view of the surroundings enriched by virtual objects. Practically all augmented reality systems rely on standard real-time rendering methods for generating the images of virtual scene elements. Although such conventional computer graphics algorithms are fast, they often fail to produce sufficiently realistic renderings. The use of simple lighting and shading methods, as well as the lack of knowledge about actual lighting conditions in the real surroundings, cause virtual objects to appear artificial. In this paper, we propose an entirely novel approach for generating augmented reality images in video see-through systems. Our method is based on the idea of applying stylization techniques for reducing the visual realism of both the camera image and the virtual graphical objects. A special painterly image filter is applied to the camera video stream. The virtual scene elements are generated using a non-photorealistic rendering method. Since both the camera image and the virtual objects are stylized in a corresponding "cartoon-like" or "sketch-like" way, they appear very similar. As a result, the graphical objects seem to be an actual part of the real surroundings. We describe both the new painterly filter for the camera image and the non-photorealistic rendering method for virtual scene elements, which has been adapted for this purpose. Both are fast enough for generating augmented reality images in real-time and are highly customizable. The results obtained using our method, are very promising and show that it improves immersion in augmented reality.},

In this paper, we study the user experience in Augmented Reality for the deployment of real-time adaptation. In the context of thin-client mobile Augmented Reality, the rate is often constrained due to limitations in the transmission link. End-to-end delay, frame rate, image size and head motion speed have been identified as important variables impacting the user experience. We propose a model to link the effect of these variables with the Quality of Experience metrics. Using this model, we present an adaptation scheme that adapts, in real time, the frame rate and the image size to maximize the Quality of Experience according to the context while satisfying the given rate constraint. Simulation shows the efficiency of the proposed scheme which achieves a better Quality of Experience than without adaptation. The adaptation still performs better than a solution with a fixed frame rate set to its maximum value.},

The operational requirements which have influenced the development of the system are discussed, and a brief reference to the history of position-finding by d.f. triangulation is followed by an account of the main technical features of the present system, with particular reference to the method of bearing transmission to the control centre and the problems of display. A practical approach to the planning of d.f. triangulation networks for specified accuracy and coverage is described, followed by details of some systems which have gone into service and of the methods used in testing them on signals from aircraft. Typical results are given. The paper concludes with an indication of the need for further development of display methods.},

abstract={This paper presents a performance comparison of local interpolation techniques based on Delaunay triangulation in generating interference maps for cognitive radio networks. The performances of nearest and natural neighbor and linear, quadratic and cubic interpolations have been evaluated in terms of primary emitter localization accuracy and RF field strength estimation efficiency for given Delaunay triangulations. The simulation results show that the linear interpolation technique provides the same level of accuracy with the other higher complexity interpolation techniques evaluated in this paper. The Delaunay triangulation is a frequently used technique for many networking tasks in wireless networks and further utilization of the actual triangulation in interpolation may provide a computationally attractive solution for the interference map generation problem in cognitive radio networks.},

abstract={GPS is the premier method of localization and way finding in outdoor environments. Indoor environments prevent GPS from functioning properly or at all. RF-based solutions have been proposed using varieties of radio triangulation and spectral fingerprinting. Such technically attractive methods have not seen widespread adoption in places where the demand is greatest: supermarkets, shopping malls, airports, etc. This may be due to the obstacles of funding, installing, or accessing sufficient wireless infrastructure for triangulation, as well as the scalability challenge in site-by-site fingerprinting. We present a framework for characterizing indoor environments. This leads to a simple, practical approach to indoor localization and wayfinding that takes advantage of visibility relationships, limited user-input, publicly available online floorplans, and lightweight processing on a mobile phone. On-site infrastructure and site-surveys are avoided. Based on this framework we find that localization precision improves dramatically as the population of landmarks grows, though few landmarks are needed during a given input cycle. We also find that indoor wayfinding is unexpectedly insensitive to hop-count, but critically dependent on path connectedness.},

abstract={Mentally disabled people in today's societies constitute a very significant minority. In most industrialized countries of today, the trend is to move mentally disabled and elderly people from institutions to homes of their own. This means that people who have not been trained to take own initiatives or cope with practical everyday matters, are sudden supposed to do so. The shift in life style and move towards integration demands technical support, not least better telecommunications and safety systems. Regrettably very little consideration is being made on behalf of the categories of citizens mentioned above. There are two kinds of barriers to be mentioned. One has to do with the poor design (ergonomy) of equipment and service facilities. The other problem has to do with the fact that technology often is not well adapted to the way a confused or mentally disabled person communicates. In order to offer remote communication facilities to mildly and moderately mentally disabled people in Sweden, projects have been going on since the late 1980s, starting with still picture telephony. In the area of safety systems, experiments are going on with video communication accompanying ordinary, voice based emergency call systems. Utilizing Cable TV systems is one possibility, but also ISDN 2×64 kbps may be useful. Another aspect of safety is the utilization of positioning systems based upon, e.g. satellite navigation (Global Positioning System) or locating systems based upon radio triangulation},

abstract={A sub-wavelength source tracking system utilizing highly miniaturized antennas in the HF range for applications in GPS-denied environments including indoor and urban scenarios is proposed. A technique that combines a high resolution direction finding and radio triangulation utilizing a compact transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) antenna system is pursued. Numerical models are used to investigate wave propagation and scattering in complex indoor scenarios as a function of frequency. We choose HF band to minimize attenuation through walls and multipath in indoor environments. In order to achieve a compact system, a low-profile and highly miniaturized antenna ( λ/300 height and λ/100 lateral dimensions at 20 MHz) having omnidirectional, vertically polarized field is designed. At such low frequencies, accurate measurement of the phase difference between the signals at the Rx antennas having very small baseline is challenging. To address this issue, a biomimetic circuit that mimics the hearing mechanism of a fly (Ormia Ochracea) is utilized. With this circuit, very small phase differences are amplified to measurable values. The numerical simulations are used to analyze direction of arrival retrieval and source localization in highly cluttered environments. A compact system prototype is also realized and source tracking in complex indoor scenarios is successfully demonstrated.},

abstract={A location and tracking system becomes very important to our future world of pervasive computing, where information is all around us. Location is one of the most needed information for emerging and future applications. Since the public use of GPS satellite is allowed, several state-of-the-art devices become part of our life, e.g. a car navigator and a mobile phone with a built-in GPS receiver. However, location information for indoor environments is still very limited. Several techniques are proposed to get location information in buildings such as using a radio signal triangulation, a radio signal (beacon) emitter, or signal fingerprinting. Using radio frequency identification (RFID) tags is a new way of giving location information to users. Due to its passive communication circuit, RFID tags can be embedded almost anywhere without an energy source. The tags stores location information and gives it to any reader that is within a proximity range which can be up to 10-15 meters for UHF RFID systems. We propose an RFID-based system for navigation in a building for blind people or visually impaired. The system relies on the location information on the tag, a userpsilas destination, and a routing server where the shortest route from the userpsilas current location to the destination. The navigation device communicates with the routing server using GPRS networks. We build a prototype based on our design and show some results. We found that there are some delay problems in the devices which are the communication delay due to the cold start cycle of a GPRS modem and the voice delay due to the file transfer delay from a MMC module.},

abstract={In this paper, a method to estimate position and orientation of a mobile system in an indoor scenario is described. The proposed method for localizing the mobile system is based on the use of signal strength values of WLAN access points in range. A radio map based method and Euclidean distance in combination with Delaunay triangulation and interpolation is proposed. The radio map method is divided in two phases. In the initial calibration phase, the radio map is built by moving around and storing signal strength values of an omnidirectional antenna and a beam antenna at various predefined points of the indoor environment. In the localization phase the mobile system moves in the same environment and the localization engine estimates position and orientation of the system. The main disadvantage of radio map based methods is the high manual effort to build the map in the calibration phase. The use of Delaunay triangulation and interpolation allows a radio map with a low density of calibration points and reduces the time for manual generation of the map. The paper presents the experimental results of measurements in an office building.},

While the radio-map technique increases accuracy and can accommodate a wireless network that is not owned by any one entity, conventional methods for constructing a radio-map are labor-intensive and impractical in such environments. We introduce a toolkit for automatically constructing outdoor radio-maps. Our toolkit can easily be carried by delivery personnel and security guards during their normal work duties to obtain signal readings. The scattered data readings are then fed into an interpolation algorithm to construct a more complete grid that can be used as the radio-map.},

abstract={The writer proposes a system for radio guidance by means of the rotating radio beacon. The system described would employ two rotating radio beacons transmitting simultaneously and on the same frequency. A radio receiver carried aboard the craft to be guided would receive the combined transmission from the two beacons. Special equipment for this receiver's output would take bearings from the two beacons and graphically triangulate to fix the position of the craft. Triangulation would be made and the position of the craft shown by means of intersecting light beams thrown upon the under surface of a map. The device would be continuous and nearly automatic in action. After the necessary initial adjustment, operation would be automatic as long as the craft stayed within effective range of the beacons. Guidance might be obtained at any point within the useful range of the beacons. There would be no limit to the number of routes and of planes served simultaneously. The routes might take any direction relative to the beacons and be as irregular as desired without decreasing effectiveness. The writer believes that with beacons suitably located the system could afford guidance for landing on a fairly large field.},

The resulting triangulation at this stage, the Delaunay triangulation, can be determined locally at each node. The topology is modified by negotiating among neighbors to satisfy a design requirement on the nodal degree parameter.

abstract={The application of orthonormal basis functions such as Prolate Spheroidal Wave Functions (PSWF) for accurate source modeling in radio astronomy has been comprehensively studied. They are of great importance for high fidelity, high dynamic range imaging with new radio tele- scopes as well as conventional ones. But the construction of PSWF is computationally expensive compared to other closed form basis functions. In this paper, we suggest a solution to reduce its computational cost by more efficient construction of the matrix kernel which relates the image domain to visibility (or Fourier) domain. Radio astronomical images are mostly represented using a regular grid of rectangular pixels. This is required for efficient storage and display purposes and moreover, comes naturally as a by product of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in imaging. We propose the use of Delaunay triangulation as opposed to regular gridding of an image for a finer selection of the region of interest (signal support) during the PSWF kernel construction. We show that the computational efficiency improves without loss of information. Once the PSWF basis is constructed using the irregular grid, we revert back to the regular grid by interpolation and thereafter, conventional imaging techniques can be applied.},

pages={935-938 vol.2},
abstract={A large variety of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are currently under development or in production. In order for an AUV to be useful, its self-navigation capabilities must support the mission requirements. Often, underwater acoustic navigation techniques must be utilized in order to meet the navigational accuracy requirements. In addition to vehicle self-navigation, most AUV operators also require a method of tracking the vehicle while it is underway, so that its progress may be monitored, and also so that it may be located easily upon surfacing, or in the event of a vehicle failure. The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) has developed a buoy-based system that simultaneously provides for both vehicle self-navigation and external tracking. This system has been used extensively by WHOI to support the REMUS AUV operations, and has also been used by the Naval Oceanographic Office to support sea-trials of the LAZARUS vehicle system. Long Baseline Acoustic Navigation is often the preferred subsea navigation method. It is generally accomplished by deploying two or more acoustic transponders, moored to the seafloor, near the desired area of operations. The vehicle then interrogates the transponders, determines its range to each, and finds its position using triangulation techniques. WHOI has developed a radio-controlled buoy, which can serve as a navigation transponder for the vehicle, and can also be commanded via the radio link to interrogate the AUV and report the measured travel time back to the operator. This paper describes the PARADIGM (Portable Acoustic RADio Geo-referenced Monitoring) system architecture, and presents data describing results achieved},

Disaster is still possible if a gas leak should occur, and mobile sensor nodes are useful to avoid this situation. Mobile sensor network system requires localization system to know its own position. In this paper, we use Kalman filter to process the radio frequency signal, and then use triangulation localization method to find its own coordinate through radio frequency (RF) signal and dead reckoning system. However, the data obtained from radio or dead reckoning is easily influenced from noise. The accuracy of localization system can be increased by using covariance intersection (CI) data fusion technique.

The growing interest towards navigation applications, the advent of the European navigation system, Galileo, and the new generation GPS, make the SDR approach an interesting perspective to develop a software reconfigurable receiver for positioning applications. Even if the present technology does not allow the total implementation of a personal communications receiver, navigation terminals demand less stringent processing and can be almost completely designed with software defined radio techniques. One of the basic functions of a navigation receiver is the signal tracking of a CDMA modulated signal-in-space (SIS) broadcast by the satellite constellation (GPS or the future European Galileo). The better the sequence alignment performed in this stage, the better are the pseudo-range measurements used for user position triangulation. The paper discusses the digital implementation of a delay-lock-loop (DLL) tailored for navigation applications where a fine synchronization is required, with the aim of keeping as small as possible the system complexity requirement for a software-defined implementation.},

abstract={Angle of arrival (AOA) estimation utilizing the MUltiple Signal Identification and Classification (MUSIC) algorithm is investigated for land vehicle location systems. A “virtual” antenna array is used to overcome problems inherent to MUSIC when operating in a highly correlated signal environment. Based on assumptions regarding the multipath radio environment, triangulation is possible by estimating the AOA of the line-of-sight (LOS) component in the received signal. Computer simulations are used to analyze the ability of techniques incorporating MUSIC to achieve this. Since triangulation is achieved using a narrowband signal, no new spectrum is required. Instead, the current cellular telephone bands as well as the existing basestation hardware could be exploited resulting in a cost-efficient and easily implemented system. A further cost reduction may be realized by processing received signal data while travelling along a nonlinear trajectory. In this way, an unambiguous angular spectrum is obtained with one antenna},

abstract={Indoor localization and monitoring system of robots and people are essential issues in robotics research. Several monitoring systems are currently under development by different investigators but they do encounter significant difficulties. For instance, a Pyroelectric Infrared (PIR) system provides less accurate information of human location and is restricted when there are multiple targets. Furthermore, a Radio Frequency (RF) localization system is constrained by its limited accuracy. In this study, we develop a system which combines PIR and RF localization system as wireless pyroelectric infrared sensory fusion system to monitor the location information of robots and people. We will reduce the error of RF localization information through tile proposed dynamic triangulation (DTN) method. We also develop a sensory fusion algorithm called the WPIR inference algorithm. This algorithm determines the fused position from both the PIR localization system and radio frequency signal localization system which utilize tile received signal strength (RSS) propagation model. We have developed and experimentally demonstrated a WPIR sensory fusion system which can be successfully applied in locating targets such as people and robot. With an accurate localization mechanism for tile indoor environment, tile provision of appropriate services to people can be realized.},

Although it has been successfully achieved in industrial robotics by using methods like optical triangulation, computer binary network, etc. Such techniques could not extend into some area of biomedicine due to the peculiarities of the human body organs. Most popular tracking methods employ radio frequency (RF) signals or ultrasound pulse waves to determine the location of the target object in 2 or 3D. A round trip time-of-flight (TOF) data is recorded for all instances of pulse-echo transmission and by using the method of triangulation, the real-time location of the test object can be computed. A modified method of acquiring the TOF data is employed in the work presented in this paper. A trajectory of the moving object was composed to within 5% accuracy using the TOF data obtained for the transmitter's motion in air and also with a layer of fluid (water) placed along the path of the transmitted pulse and the receiver},

abstract={Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, SLAM, is an important topic in the field of robotics and autonomous navigation. The metric SLAM suffers from sensor inaccuracies and thus cannot be used for long-term navigation. In such case, Visual SLAM or a Hybrid SLAM based on both metric and visual approach is a good alternative. In this paper, in order to speed up a Visual SLAM, we propose a novel concept of dynamic dictionary generated on the results of triangulation done on RF, radio frequency, signals from nearest cell towers of a cellular network. This dynamic dictionary efficiently manages the scalability of a Visual SLAM and make it possible to work in a large-scale environment. A framework is proposed along with triangulation data of a city and with simulations to support the concept.},

abstract={Over the last years, many different methods have been proposed for indoor localization and navigation services based on Radio frequency (RF) technology and Radio Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). The accuracy achieved with such systems is typically low, mainly due to the variability of RSSI values, unsuitable for classic localization methods (e.g. triangulation). In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on multiple neural networks. We demonstrate with experimental results that by training and then activating different neural networks, tailored on the user orientation, high definition accuracy is achievable, allowing indoor navigation with a cost effective Bluetooth (BT) architecture.},

title={Prognosis of collapse of the osteonecrosis of the femoral head for patients treated with a tantalum rod by determining location and size of the lesion},
year={2009},
pages={1-4},
abstract={The purpose of this study is to predict the osteone-crosis of the femoral head by examining the location and size of the lesion of the femoral head. A triangulation approximation algorithm is used for the computation of the geometric center of the lesion based on magnetic resonce imaging scans for patients treated with a tantalum rod. Twenty eight patients (thirty four hips) with osteonecrosis of the femoral head were treated with the tantalum rod procedure. Then mean age was 39,21 years (14 - 59). All necrotic lesions were confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. A customized triangulation approximation algorithm was developed in order to compute the geometric center of the lesion of the reconstructed model. Lesion volume, the distance from the origin (? or R), latitude (?) and longitude (?) of the geometric center of the lesion within the femoral head were calculated. The mean follow-up was 3 (1-7) years. Ten hips (29.4%) showed radiographic progression. Statistical method Cox regression analysis showed that lesion volume and longitude angle (?) were important factors to predict radiographic progression. Lesions having an angle (?) of [15? - 35?] and [50 ?- 60 ?] and size c in Steinberg scale with lesion size greater than 27% of the femoral head were more likely to develop radiographic progression. For hips that developed radio-graphic progression out of this range, lesion size was the only significant factor. The results suggest that lesion volume is an important factor strongly correlated with the risk of collapse of the femoral head. The location of the lesion of the necrotic area is an important supplemental parameter in order to predict with accuracy the progression of the disease. However further studies with the current algorithm that computes the geometric center of the lesion, larger study groups and long-term follow-up are needed in order to predict accurately the progression of the disease and the collapse of the femoral head.},

abstract={Since wireless networks provide flexibility, mobility and convenience in setup, they became more widespread today. However, due to the nature of wireless networks that use shared medium for communications it needs more security features as its wired counterpart. Attackers can use proper devices and techniques to pull signals from the air and gain access to the unprotected wireless networks from anywhere in range of wireless network which receive wireless signals. Therefore, it is very difficult to trace back to the attacker. The three current location tracking solution: closest access point, triangulation and radio frequency fingerprinting have their own limitations in tracing wireless intruders. In this paper, in the beginning we consider discovering wireless networks techniques and then overview the three current solutions for location tracking and also propose an amendment for triangulation method that aims to overcome the limitations of this method.},

abstract={A radio location system operates by measuring physical quantities related to radio signals traveling between a mobile terminal (MT) and a set of fixed base stations (BSs). In order to reduce the implementation complexity and the signalling overhead, the solution presented makes use of a single BS to locate unmodified MTs. The novel algorithm applies a triangulation technique supported by minimal information about the environment in the BS neighborhood. The proposed algorithm is compatible with the architecture of 3G cellular networks, as it relies on CDMA (code division multiple access) signalling and a BS array antenna for the estimation of the time delay and of the angle of arrival, respectively. Despite its modest implementation complexity, the proposed algorithm can predict the MT position with a fairly good accuracy, as demonstrated by numerical tests performed by resorting to a fully 3D deterministic propagation model developed at the University of Pisa.},

title={A Fuzzy Logic Based System for Indoor Localisation Using WiFi in Ambient Intelligent Environments},
year={2012},
volume={PP},
number={99},
pages={1-1},
abstract={Ambient Intelligence is a new information paradigm where people are empowered through a digital environment that is “aware” of their presence and context, and is sensitive, adaptive and responsive to their needs [23]. Hence, one of the important requirements for Ambient Intelligent Environments (AIEs) is the ability to localise the whereabouts of the user in the AIE to address her/his needs. In order to protect the user privacy, the use of cameras is not desirable in AIEs and hence there is a need to rely on non intrusive sensors. There are various localisation means available for outdoor spaces such as those which rely on satellite signals triangulation. However, these outdoor localisation means cannot be used in indoor environments. The majority of non intrusive and non camera based indoor localisation systems require the installation of extra hardware such as ultra sound emitters/antennas, RFID antennas, etc. In this paper, we will propose a novel indoor localisation system which is based on the WiFi signals which are free to receive and they are available in abundance in the majority of domestic spaces. However, the free WiFi signals are noisy and uncertain and their strengths and availability are continuously changing. Hence, we will present a fuzzy logic based system which employs the free available WiFi signals to localise a given user in AIEs. The proposed system receives WiFi signals from a big number of existing WiFi Access Points (up to 170 Access Points) where no prior knowledge of the access points locations and the environment is required. The system employs an incremental life long learning approach to adjust its behaviour to the varying and changing WiFi signals to provide a zero cost localisation system which can provide high accuracy in real world living spaces. We have compared our system in both simulated and real environments to the other relevant techniques in the literature and we have found that our system outperforms the oth- r systems in the offline learning process, whereas our system was the only system capable of performing online learning and adaptation. The proposed system was tested in real world spaces from a living lab intelligent apartment (iSpace) to a town centre apartment to block of offices. In all these experiments, our system has given high accuracy to detect the user in the given AIEs and the system was able to adapt its behaviour to changes in the AIE or the WiFi signals. We envisage the proposed system to play an important role in AIEs especially for privacy concerned situations like elderly care scenarios.},

abstract={In this research paper we undertook the problem of location determination of mobile nodes in a wireless local area network, as finding out the location in a wireless environment is to-date not very easy, cheap and accurate using 802.11b technology. We used the classical method of triangulation with a little alteration which is later on described in the paper. Another method we used is the methods of calibration by research to produce more accurate results and also to cross verify the results of the method of triangulation. The work in this paper attempts to illustrate the different aspects of the problem of location determination in WiFi networks. We started with an investigation of the influence that network characteristics have on the ability of middleware location determination protocols to accurately estimate position of mobile nodes. We presented an implementation based study that demonstrated the strong relationship between the two of the location determination methods and their performance. The main objective of this paper is to provide method in which no dedication hardware is required. Only wireless LAN card is required and can be placed in any suitable location. The significance of this result lies in allowing a network designer to make a suitable tradeoff between QoS of location determination and other application protocols while choosing a network topology. The combination of two methods reduced the error rate of locating a mobile node to a great extent. The results were being plotted on a given map using both the algorithms},

abstract={We use a steerable beam directional antenna mounted on a moving vehicle to localize roadside WiFi access points (APs), located outdoors or inside buildings. Localizing APs is an important step towards understanding the topologies and network characteristics of large scale WiFi networks that are deployed in a chaotic fashion in urban areas. The idea is to estimate the angle of arrival of frames transmitted from the AP using signal strength information on different directional beams of the antenna - as the beam continuously rotates while the vehicle is moving. This information together with the GPS locations of the vehicle are used in a triangulation approach to localize the APs. We show how this method must be extended using a clustering approach to account for multi-path reflections in cluttered environments. Our technique is completely passive requiring minimum effort beyond driving the vehicle around in the neighborhood where the APs need to be localized, and is able to improve the localization accuracy by an order of magnitude compared with trilateration approaches using omnidirectional antennas, and by a factor of two relative to other known techniques using directional antennas.},

abstract={The conventional Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) is composed of mobile nodes without any infrastructure. But, emergent traffic such as disaster positioning by using wireless infrastructure is indeed required. Therefore, network deployment for ad-hoc would associate WiMax with WiFi which is called 802.16e MANET Environment in this paper. Based on the 802.16e MANET environment, we propose a novel Hierarchical Multicast Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing protocol (H-MAODV) for supporting multicast traffic rather than multiple unicast. The proposed H-MAODV scheme can avoid significant number of route discovery cost by using various bounded wireless coverage areas. On the other hand, Two-Points Positioning (TPP) for a paradigm of 802.16e MANET Environment is also proposed to solve the drawback of conventional triangulation method. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed TPP outperforms conventional triangulation method. Moreover, by using proposed multicast service for H-MAODV applying in our deployed 802.16e MANET environment, emergent traffic for disaster positioning information would be delivered out immediately.},

It mainly receives the positioning satellite signals from over three satellites, and uses triangulation technique to compute the position. The satellite signals are easily interfered by non-line-of-sight (NLOS) wave and climate; thus, create significant positioning errors. The positioning technology based on wireless local area networks (or WiFi) has matured gradually in recent years. The pattern matching method that takes the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) at the receiving end as the fingerprinting is one of the key technologies. In order to improve the precision of positioning under unfavorable weather conditions or in NLOS outdoor environment, this study proposed a positioning technology based on a portable mobile device with GPS and WiFi-based pattern matching method, to design a selective weighting scheme. The experiments validated that the proposed technology is effective with an average positioning error of 3.8 m less than that of GPS.},

	abstract = {This paper reports an electroencephalogram-based brain-actuated telepresence system to provide a user with presence in remote environments through a mobile robot, with access to the Internet. This system relies on a P300-based brain-computer interface (BCI) and a mobile robot with autonomous navigation and camera orientation capabilities. The shared-control strategy is built by the BCI decoding of task-related orders (selection of visible target destinations or exploration areas), which can be autonomously executed by the robot. The system was evaluated using five healthy participants in two consecutive steps: 1) screening and training of participants and 2) preestablished navigation and visual exploration telepresence tasks. On the basis of the results, the following evaluation studies are reported: 1) technical evaluation of the device and its main functionalities and 2) the users' behavior study. The overall result was that all participants were able to complete the designed tasks, reporting no failures, which shows the robustness of the system and its feasibility to solve tasks in real settings where joint navigation and visual exploration were needed. Furthermore, the participants showed great adaptation to the telepresence system.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the control concept of a semi-mobile haptic interface for extended range telepresence that enables the user to explore spatially unrestricted target environments even from a small user environment. The semi-mobile haptic interface consists of a haptic manipulator mounted on a large grounded Cartesian robot, the prepositioning unit. The prepositioning unit is controlled in such a way that the haptic manipulator is kept off its workspace limits. At the same time, the control algorithm allows the optimal utilization of the available space in the user environment and guarantees the safety of the user. The proposed control method is based on the position and velocity of the end-effector and also takes the position of the user into account. Moreover, it is robust against noisy measurements of the user position or outliers due, for example, to occlusions in the tracking system. Experimental results show the suitability of the proposed control to provide haptic interaction in extended range telepresence.},

The display system is a television display system that can be worn like a pair of glasses. The head movements of the user are monitored using color tracking, and the displayed images are updated accordingly. This is achieved by interpreting the human head movements and transforming them into control signals for the robot and its mounted color camera. Novel features of the presented system include: utilization of human implicit commands, availability and cost-effectiveness of the system, feeling of presence, and intelligence fusion of the human user with robot's intelligence.

This method is used in our second-generation mutually immersive mobile telepresence system, where only the region containing a user's head in an acquired video stream needs to be displayed at the remote location. This editing is performed in a way that leaves the resulting stream consistent with the MPEG-2 standard. We currently reduce the transmission of data by skipping macroblocks or deleting DCT coefficients outside the region of interest in P and B pictures, and deleting DCT coefficients in I frames. This results in a savings of approximately 50\% of the bandwidth of the original stream for our application. Since we are transmitting four video streams to the surrogate over our wireless network, the total bandwidth is reduced by about 5 Mbit/s. As an added benefit, the CPU requirements for decoding the edited stream in software are also reduced by approximately 16\%.},

	abstract = {The authors' institute has established that precise surgical procedures can be carried out with Telepresence. Within this decade, Telepresence surgery may become an established component of a new, technologically enhanced mode of cost-effective health care delivery. Because of the substantial medical and financial benefit that Telepresence will bring to laparoscopic and other minimally invasive procedures, its first routine use is expected to be within the individual hospital and surgical center. Telepresence surgical procedures have been demonstrated over distances of 160 meters, and the authors are working toward demonstrating animal surgeries over a much greater distance by using microwave and fiber-optic links. Mobile Telepresence surgical equipment may prove especially effective for trauma care in combat and in civilian disasters. Because the stereographic images and the motions and forces can be readily scaled, microsurgeries of all kinds can be made easier with this technology. Arthroscopic procedures, especially difficult surgery on joints such as the wrist and shoulder, are good Telepresence candidates. In neurosurgery, excision of pituitary adenomas could benefit from the increased dexterity and tactile sensitivity of Telepresence. Eventually, neurosurgery under real-time magnetic resonance imaging could be performed by a Telepresence surgeon operating on a three dimensional reconstruction that is immediately updated to show the actual tissue changes caused by the telemanipulated instruments},

Our goal is to recreate to the greatest extent practical, both for the user and the people at the remote location, the sensory experience relevant for face-to-face interactions of the user actually being in the remote location. To enhance immersion for the user, our second-generation system can automatically preserve the head height of the user at the remote location. In order to eliminate loss of immersion due to teleoperation delays, in our third generation system we are eliminating one class of teleoperated mechanical motion by allowing rotations to take place at the user{\rq}s location instead of at the remote location. A key component of this is a low-profile synchronous drive base. We also provide a novel natural interface for controlling translational motion at the remote location.},

A mobile teleoperator in the remote environment replicates this motion. The user can thus control the mobile teleoperator's locomotion by walking. A stereo-camera system mounted on the mobile teleoperator constantly records live camera images and transfers them to the user environment, where they are presented to the user on a head-mounted display. This paper presents a long distance experiment, in which a mobile teleoperator was controlled over a standard Internet connection by natural locomotion. Without further processing of the user's motion data, however, only exploration of a remote environment of the same size or smaller than the user environment is possible. As this is not desirable, we use motion compression, an optimal nonlinear transformation of the user's path. This algorithm allows controlling free motion in an arbitrarily large target environment from a limited user environment.},

The robotic system consists of a mobile robot and a wearable master robot. The elaborated algorithms allow the robot to precisely recognize the shape, boundaries, movement direction, speed, and distance to the obstacle by means of the laser range finders. The designed tactile belt interface receives the detected information and maps it through the vibrotactile patterns. We designed the patterns in such a way that they convey the obstacle parameters in a very intuitive, robust, and unobtrusive manner. The robot movement direction and speed are governed by the tilt of the user's torso. The sensors embedded into the belt interface measure the user orientation and gestures precisely. Such an interface lets to deeply engage the user into the teleoperation process and to deliver them the tactile perception of the remote environment at the same time. The key point is that the user gets the opportunity to use own arms, hands, fingers for operation of the robotic manipulators and another devices installed on the mobile robot platform. The experimental results of user study revealed the effectiveness of the designed vibration patterns for obstacle parameter presentation. The accuracy in 100\% for detection of the moving object by participants was achieved. We believe that the developed robotic system has significant potential in facilitating the navigation of mobile robot while providing a high degree of immersion into remote space.},

In particular, teleoperated mobile robots need to have some kind of backup system when the operator is blind to the remote situation owing to failure of the vision system. In Hong S-G et al. (see Mechatronics), the idea of artificial force reflection was proposed to enhance the reliability of operation when the mobile robot travels over plain ground. We extend these results to help the teleoperator even when the robot climbs stairs. The extended artificial force reflection method has two modes: traveling on plain ground and climbing stairs. When traveling over plain ground, the force information is artificially generated using range data from the environment while generating the impulse force when climbing stairs. To verify the validity of our algorithm, we develop a simulator which consists of a joystick and visual display system. Through experiments using this system, we confirm the validity and effectiveness of our new artificial force reflection in teleoperated mobile robots},

	abstract = {Robotic assistance through telepresence technology is an emerging area in aiding the visually impaired. By integrating the robotic perception of a remote environment and transferring it to a human user through haptic environmental feedback, the disabled user can increase one's capability to interact with remote environments through the telepresence robot. This paper presents a framework that integrates visual perception from heterogeneous vision sensors and enables real-time interactive haptic representation of the real world through a mobile manipulation robotic system. Specifically, a set of multi-disciplinary algorithms such as stereovision processes, three-dimensional map building algorithms, and virtual-proxy haptic rendering processes are integrated into a unified framework to accomplish the goal of real-world haptic exploration successfully. Results of our framework in an indoor environment are displayed, and its performances are analyzed. Quantitative results are provided along with qualitative results through a set of human subject testing. Our future work includes real-time haptic fusion of multi-modal environmental perception and more extensive human subject testing in a prolonged experimental design.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses and evaluates the role of shared control approach in a BCI-based telepresence framework. Driving a mobile device by using human brain signals might improve the quality of life of people suffering from severely physical disabilities. By means of a bidirectional audio/video connection to a robot, the BCI user is able to interact actively with relatives and friends located in different rooms. However, the control of robots through an uncertain channel as a BCI may be complicated and exhaustive. Shared control can facilitate the operation of brain-controlled telepresence robots, as demonstrated by the experimental results reported here. In fact, it allows all subjects to complete a rather complex task, driving the robot in a natural environment along a path with several targets and obstacles, in shorter times and with less number of mental commands.},

TELEROBOT is a teleoperated mobile robotic platform equipped with videoconferencingcapabilities and designed to be used in a home environment to. In this study, learnability of the system's teleoperation interface and controls was evaluated with ten rehabilitation professionals during four training sessions in a laboratory environment and in an unknown home environment while performing the execution of a standardized evaluation protocol typically used in home care. Results show that the novice teleoperators' performances on two of the four metrics used (number of command and total time) improved significantly across training sessions (ANOVAS, p<;0.05) and that performance in these metrics in the last training session reflected teleoperation abilities seen in the unknown home environment during navigation tasks (r=0,77 and 0,60). With only 4 hours of training, rehabilitation professionals were able learn to teleoperate successfully TELEROBOT. However teleoperation performances remained significantly less efficient then those of an expert. Under the home task condition (navigating the home environment from one point to the other as fast as possible) this translated to completion time between 350 seconds (best performance) and 850 seconds (worse performance). Improvements in other usability aspects of the system will be needed to meet the requirements of in-home telerehabilitation.},

The techniques employed allow children to rapidly gain access to a large repository of multimedia information through the use of a camera- equipped mobile phone. Especially, there are many usages of external marks (EM) on the off-line contents. To tackle this problem, a few researches use content-based image retrieval (CBIR) based on object colors to recognize real images with a simple computation. However, this has problems of low recognition rates and slows processing on mobile devices with low-resolution camera. There are three issues should be considered in this research field: (1) low recognition rates, (2) fast processing, and (3) rotation-size invariant. To solve drawbacks that use of the EM and difficulty of the color-based image retrieval (CoBIR) by means of a low-resolution camera-equipped mobile phone, we used for shape-based image retrieval (SBIR) system. The ALC can provide learners with quick and accurate on-line contents on off-line using mobile devices without limitations of space. Our aim was to establish whether or not this user interaction technique could be harnessed for education based applications targeted at young children.},

It is also the prerequisites of enhancing the quality of rural education. With the implementation of the modern distance education in the rural primary and secondary schools (referred as rural distance education), the work of continuing education of teachers in the rural areas has been significantly improved. But there are still many other difficulties such as the rural teachers' work pressure, lacking of time; Lacking of continuity of continuing education, cannot be long-term support; Limited of teaching resources, inadequate sharing, etc. This compels us to find an effective method to help resolving problem of the continuing education of teachers in the rural primary and secondary schools. With the rapid development wireless mobile communicational technology and the increasing popularity of mobile terminals, mobile learning has slowly becomes a new way of continuing education for teachers. The purpose of this study is to help improving the problem of education and training of rural teachers through the mobile learning and mobile services.},

Mobile tools immerse in the learning environment and surround the educators, the students and the environment they operate in. These tools can be directly integrated in classroom activities in order to enhance and promote new ways of teaching and learning. The purpose of this research work is to evaluate the viability of integrating mobile technology into the teaching and learning processes in higher education from the faculty perspective. The study focuses on faculty members working in private colleges in Cyprus, and is guided by the following research objectives: to determine the general knowledge of faculty members on mobile technologies and learning, to explore the perceptions of educators regarding mobile technology integration, to determine the current level of educators' (from different disciplines) knowledge on mobile technologies, to measure the degree in which educators are willing to integrate mobile devices in their classroom practices, to identify the factors that influence mobile technology integration in education, and to propose a strategy for the introduction of m- learning integration. To address the above, a mixed method approach is employed [1, 2]. The study makes use of both quantitative and qualitative data. The purpose of this mixed method is to use "qualitative results to assist in explaining, interpreting and further examining the findings of the quantitative study" [1]. The results of this work allow for determining the viability of integrating mobile devices in education from the educators' perspective. This preliminary research paper is the foundation of a series of papers to investigate the feasibility of integrating mobile devices in the classrooms. The results of the study provide the foundation of examining the feasibility of mobile integration in other formal, non-formal or informal educational sett- - ings, countries and levels.},

	abstract = {Mobile laboratories refer to self-contained, traveling laboratories that accommodate student participation in hands-on laboratory science aboard the mobile laboratory unit. Most of the mobile laboratory programs that are now in operation focus on providing middle and high school students and teachers with access to science equipment and supplies that are difficult for them to acquire and maintain. In addition, many of the mobile laboratory programs provide inquiry-based curricular materials that are engaging, substantive, and thought provoking. Further, since mobile laboratories are completely self-sustained and can travel to urban and rural locations that are often educationally and economically disadvantaged, they provide equal access to state-of the art learning opportunities. The use of mobile laboratories is an innovative way to transform science teaching and learning, particularly in the pre-college setting. While many of the mobile laboratory programs now in operation focus on the biological sciences, we believe that these programs can be adapted to broader applications in STEM education. Mobile laboratories have the potential to offer powerful and unique ways to engage and inspire future scientists and engineers. These ``vehicles'' may pique the curiosity of students and motivate them to continue their study of science in high school and beyond. As such, mobile science laboratories may contribute to increasing the number of students who become science-literate citizens and members of the science workforce.},

The paper presents the problem and makes a research on combining mobile learning with eLML. ELML, which is released by University of Zurich (Switzerland), is a kind of e-Lesson markup language based on XML framework. It is independent on any special learning platforms and abides by SCORM standard. Additionally, eLML has features of being powerful transplantable capability and easily integrates with mainstream e-learning platforms. Therefore, it recommends applying eLML to the mobile learning application field. However, there are two problems, which have prevented eLML from using at mobile learning platforms. (1) Not all mobile devices can read eLML contents directly; (2) eLML cannot recognize mobile devices automatically and cannot optimize e-Lesson contents in accordance with capabilities of mobile devices. To solve them, the paper proposes to make use of multi-serving technologies to recognize mobile devices and then generate mobile learning materials according to devices' capabilities. On the above of studies, the paper introduces an approach on how to design and implement a mobile learning system architecture based on eLML framework. It also finds a solution on how to integrate eLML mobile learning materials with current e-Learning platform seamlessly.},

However, most of current learning resources (LR) were designed with desktop computers and high-speed network connections. Moreover, for different user preferences in mobile learning environment, not all of the data are relevant and critical to the learning process. It is a challenge to deliver such learning resources to various devices with limited capability over low-speed wireless network while ensuring higher synthetically quality of learning resource. To solve above problem, in this paper we proposed a Learning Resource Adaptation and Delivery Framework to adapt learning resources to various learning environments. It consists of two layers: multimedia adaptation layer and learning object adaptation layer. In the multimedia adaptation layer, MPEG-21 Digital Item Adaptation (DIA) mechanism is incorporated to handle the adaptation of low-level multimedia contents contained in learning resources. In the learning object layer, the appropriate selection of learning objects is based on an extended Learning Object Model for mobile learning. With the introduction of an integrated quality mechanism filling the quality metrics gap between high-level learning objects and low-level multimedia objects, an adaptation decision algorithm is presented to ensure higher final adaptation quality of learning resources},

Technology progress in the field of learning has evolved especially with the use of e-learning and now with the emergence of a new concept called m-learning due to mobile technologies, which are probably the most influential technology for teaching and learning in the next decade. Internet access remains inaccessible to most of our students. But almost all students have access to mobile technology. Nevertheless, the m-learning has some constraints in the use of mobile technologies such as the size of the screen which is too small for reading, battery life that is in constant progress but still low for e-learning applications, user interfaces that are not user-friendly on most mobile phones and diversity of mobile devices and the rapidly changing trends suggest producing ``LMS mobiles'' adaptable to a wide range of mobiles. To avoid redundancy in the reproduction of content that exists in the e-learning environment, we combined in this approach the use of mobile device in the blended learning to offer to our students the opportunity to be mobile and use the mobile as the medium of information. In this paper the benefits of mobile-learning and its use in the INTTIC's Moodle platform are presented. A new way to send information to different learners is developed, relying on the multimedia podcasting technology. This latter is still relatively new and not widely known.},

	abstract = {With the recent advancement in mobile computing technologies, there has been a paradigm shift from electronic learning(e-learning) to distance learning(d-learning) to mobile learning(m-learning). M-learning not only provides educational oppurtunities through handheld devices, but also facilitates just in time information required at the right time and right place. Though m-learning provides mobility and instant access to education, there are some implementation challenges and issues like limited processing capability and small screen display that needs researchers attention. Keeping in view the latest trends in Information, Electronics and Communication Technologies(IECT) and the increased usage of mobile phones in India, this paper discusses mobile learning technologies, opportunities and challenges for success-full implementation of m-learning. It is observed that most of the students in India use low cost mobile phones that too with different hardware capabilities and features. Researchers and developers in education domain should consider these mobile capabilities and challenges before developing m-learning video content. Pilot experiment was conducted to study different mobile video presentation styles, file formats and their playback capabilities using students mobile phones. Students from various finishing schools were involved in carrying out this experiment. Based on pilot results, instructional design strategy and mobile video content development guidelines were formulated catering to the requirements of student community in India.},

	abstract = {Mobile learning, the learning method which learners can leverage mobile devices to learn everywhere, has become the one of the most potential learning approach as novel mobile devices emerges. However, how the novel mobile learning technology can be accepted by learners was seldom addressed. Meanwhile, due to the unavailability of large number (more than 100) experts for evaluating novel mobile learning devices, the traditional statistical methods, e.g. the structural equation model (SEM), are not appropriate for evaluating the factors influencing the acceptance of novel techniques, a feasible research framework will be very helpful for achieving the evaluation purposes. In this work, the author proposes a novel technology acceptance modeling (TAM) evaluation framework with the fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) based Network Process (DNP) to resolve the above mentioned real world problem. The SEM based analytic results based on learners will be introduced for demonstrating the effectiveness of the Fuzzy DNP. An empirical study based on the analysis of factors influencing Taiwanese mobile learners' acceptances of some specific mobile learning software being installed in iPhone will be introduced for demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. Based on the analytic results, the Fuzzy DNP based framework can be used for real world technology acceptance analysis of novel mobile learning techniques. Meanwhile, the derived factors which can influence the mobile learning technology acceptances can serve as the basis for educators and marketers for designing and improving the next generation learning devices.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the importance of providing adaptive learning services has noticeably increased in web-based learning environments. Context-aware learning is an excellent solution to customizing learning, since by taking learners' context information into consideration, learning could be offered in a personalized manner, and as a result, the efficiency of the learning process will increase. Moreover, with mobile and handheld devices being widely used nowadays, mobile learning could be viewed as another option for customization of learning. In this paper, a learning model is introduced, based on which context-aware mobile learning capability is added to a learning management system (LMS). With this goal, learner's context information (i.e. his mood and his desired view of the system) is demanded from him, according to which he is provided with a learning environment appropriately structured for his context. The proposed model was tested on a group of learners to assess the performance of the added component from a user point of view. Comparing the personalized LMS with the original one, the results demonstrated a significant enhancement of learners' satisfaction and the quality of learning. Using the presented approach, learning will be a less time-consuming and more efficient process, leading to a more extensive use of learning management systems.},

The proposed BWL system was designed using a wireless mobile ad-hoc learning environment. In our designed system, each individual learner has a wireless handheld device, which is a PDA (personal digital assistant) with an IEEE 802.11 wireless network card and a small-sized CCD camera. One instructor has a notebook computer with a wi-fi wireless LAN card which serves as the local server. The notebook has a complete butterfly database. All learners' wireless handheld devices and the notebook constitute a mobile ad-hoc learning environment. During the butterfly-watching activity, each learner takes a distinct butterfly picture, and wirelessly transmits the picture to the local server. A content-based butterfly-image retrieval technique is applied to search for the most closely matching butterfly information, which is returned in real time to the learner's wireless handheld device. To illustrate the effect of the BWL system, an outdoor BWL activity was actually performed at elementary school in Taiwan. This article reports on our attempts to develop a new m-learning system to support an independent learning model. We deeply believe that it is worth developing a mobile learning system to provide a possible independent-learning environment for outdoor learners.},

@article{4801602,
	abstract = {Video surveillance has been widely used in recent years to enhance public safety and privacy protection. A video surveillance system that deals with content analysis and activity monitoring needs efficient transmission and storage of the surveillance video data. Video compression techniques can be used to achieve this goal by reducing the size of the video with no or small quality loss. State-of-the-art video compression methods such as H.264/AVC often lead to high computational complexity at the encoder, which is generally implemented in a video camera in a surveillance system. This can significantly increase the cost of a surveillance system, especially when a mass deployment of end cameras is needed. In this paper, we discuss the specific considerations for surveillance video compression. We present a surveillance video compression system with low-complexity encoder based on Wyner-Ziv coding principles to address the tradeoff between computational complexity and coding efficiency. In addition, we propose a backward-channel aware Wyner-Ziv (BCAWZ) video coding approach to improve the coding efficiency while maintaining low complexity at the encoder. The experimental results show that for surveillance video contents, BCAWZ can achieve significantly higher coding efficiency than H.264/AVC intra coding as well as existing Wyner-Ziv video coding methods and is close to H.264/AVC inter coding, while maintaining similar coding complexity with intra coding. This shows that the low motion characteristics of many surveillance video contents and the low-complexity encoding requirement make our scheme a particularly suitable candidate for surveillance video compression. We further propose an error resilience scheme for BCAWZ to address the concern of reliable transmission in the backward-channel, which is essential to the quality of video data for real-time and reliable object detection and event analysis.},

This paper presents an improved video compression algorithm for lane supervision, which considers the implementation of video retrieval at the stage of video compression. This improved video compression algorithm combines the following three parts: shot segmentation based on detection of moving vehicle; key frame extraction based on vehicle-license- plate locating; video compression in which the I frame, B frame and P frame is decided by the former two steps. Experimental results show that the algorithm presented in this paper not only increases the compression ratio, but also improves the quality of the video reverting from compressed video and improves the efficiency and performance of the later video retrieval.},

	abstract = {Wireless video sensor networks are anticipated to be deployed to monitor remote geographical areas. To save energy in bit transmissions/receptions over a video sensor network, the captured video content needs to be encoded before its transmission to the base station. However, video encoding is an inherently complex operation that can cause a major energy drain at battery-constrained sensors. Thus a systematic evaluation of different video encoding options is required to allow a designer to choose the most energy-efficient compression technique for a given video sensing application scenario. In this paper, we empirically evaluate the energy efficiencies of predictive and distributed video coding paradigms for deployment on real-life sensor motes. For predictive video coding, our results show that despite its higher compression efficiency, inter video coding always depletes much more energy than intra coding. Therefore, we propose to use image compression based intra coding to improve energy efficiency in the predictive video coding paradigm. For distributed video coding, our results show that the Wyner-Ziv encoder has consistently better energy efficiency than the PRISM encoder. We propose minor modifications to PRISM and Wyner-Ziv encoders which significantly reduce the energy consumption of these encoders. For all the video encoding configurations evaluated in this paper, our results reveal the counter-intuitive and important finding that the major source of energy drain in WSNs is local computations performed for video compression and not video transmission.},

	abstract = {Video monitoring is often conducted in hospitals. In case of prolonged monitoring, huge amounts of data are generated. There is a high demand for very efficient video compression methods. The current medical video systems utilize standard compression algorithms such as MPEG-1 and MPEG-2, which were designed for generic video rather than medical video. The features of this type of video such as long idle periods and small local motions, are not sufficiently addressed in these standards. As a result, current systems produce considerable redundancy in the output data. In this paper, we present a two-step method to compress medical monitoring video more efficiently. In the first step, a novel algorithm is utilized to detect the motion activities of the input video sequence. Then, the video sequence is segmented into several rectangle image regions (video object planes), which contain motion activities restricted within these windows. In the second step, the generated video object planes are compressed by an MPEG-4 module (or any module that features high compression efficiency). Our experimental results show that the two-step method improves the compression ratio significantly when compared with the existing generic MPEG algorithms while still retaining the essential video quality.},

Compared to H.264/AVC and H.26L-FGS video coding, the advantage of Witsenhausen-Wyner video coding and layered Wyner-Ziv video coding is error robustness when the compressed video has to be delivered over a noisy channel. The price for this added error robustness is a small loss of compression performance. In multiterminal video coding for video sensor network applications, since the encoders are not allowed to communicate with each other, the use of distributed source coding is out of necessity. We propose a generic scheme for multiterminal video coding based on Slepian-Wolf coded quantization, where we explore multiple view geometry in computer vision to generate the side information. Experimental results with two- and three-view video sequences show that our multiterminal video coder can achieve a lower sum-rate than separate H.264/AVC coding. Comparison with the standard JMVM joint encoding scheme is also provided.},

However state-of-the-art video compression techniques do not achieve compression levels which are large enough to transmit video data on low band-width links. Thus compression levels need to be improved by a factor of 2 to 10 before they will become useful on the kinds of links which may be encountered in personal communications and cellular telephony. In this paper we present a new video compression technique which makes use of temporal subsampling and reconstruction of frames.

However, due to its inherent data intensity of video sequences, storing and transmitting raw video data become impractical. With the limited storage and bandwidth capacity, this data must be compressed to a transportable size and finally decompressed to reach the destination. For this purpose, we studied and implemented two well known video compression and decompression algorithms i.e. Run Length Encoding (RLE) and Arithmetic Coding (AC). The main advantage of these compression techniques is that it almost compresses and decompresses all types of video files. In this work, we computed the compression rate on different video files by applying both algorithms. Experimentally, we find that AC algorithm compressed better in almost all types of video files except DAT type video file, and we also find that the compression rate of DAT file is highest and RLE performed better in it.},

This technique achieves efficient compression by separating coherently moving objects from stationary background and compactly representing their shape, motion, and the content. In addition to providing improved coding efficiency at very low bit rates, the technique provides the ability to selectively encode, decode, and manipulate individual objects in a video stream. This technique supports all three MPEG-4 functionalities tested in the November 1995 tests, namely, improved coding efficiency, error resilience, and content scalability. This paper also describes the error protection and concealment schemes that enable robust transmission of compressed video over noisy communication channels such as analog phone lines and wireless links. The noise introduced by the communication channel is characterized by both burst errors and random bit errors.

Selective key frame identification uses shot boundary detection and frame differencing methods to identify representative frames which are subsequently kept in high resolution within the compressed container. All other non-key frames are downscaled for compression purposes. Patch-based super-resolution finds similar patches between an up scaled non-key frame and the associated, high-resolution key frame to regain lost detail via a super-resolution process. The algorithm was integrated into the H.264 video compression pipeline tested on web cam, cartoon and live-action video for both streaming and storage purposes.

The first set of experiments shows that compared with MPEG-4, H.264 can achieve a significant average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) gain of up to 4.35 dB for the test medical video sequences, and thus is much more effective when applied in medical video compression.

In this model, the temporal ordering and the spatial viewpoints of the video streams being viewed are completely determined at authoring time. In contrast, we have defined a form of interactive video called active video (see http://www.ecsl.cs.sunysb.edu/∼anindya/avs/avs.html, 2002), which supports hyper-linking among related video sequences and interpolation of video sequences with neighboring viewpoints, to offer end users the additional flexibility of choosing the sequencing and the viewing angle (even virtual ones) at playback time. However, active video has a substantially higher storage and transmission cost due to multiple time-synchronized video streams capturing the dynamic scene and the pixel-level correspondence maps encoding the spatial association among the frame-pairs of all adjacent streams. The maps are interpolated at run-time to generate virtual views. We describe and evaluate the following three compression techniques that alleviate the storage and network transmission costs of active video: spatial video compression; lossy map compression; lossless map compression.},

However, in the current broadcasting chain, there are no provisions for enabling an efficient transmission/storage of these mixed video and graphics signals and, at this emerging stage of DTV systems, introducing new standards is not desired. Nevertheless, in the professional video communication chain between content provider and broadcaster and locally, in the DTV receiver, proprietary video-graphics compression schemes can be used to enable more efficient transmission/storage of mixed video and graphics signals. For example, in the DTV receiver case this will lead to a significant memory-cost reduction. To preserve a high overall image quality, the video and graphics data require independent coding systems, matched with their specific visual and statistical properties. We introduce various efficient algorithms that support both the lossless (contour, runlength and arithmetic coding) and the lossy (block predictive coding) compression of graphics data. If the graphics data are a-priori mixed with video and the graphics position is unknown at compression time, an accurate detection mechanism is applied to distinguish the two signals, such that independent coding algorithms can be employed for each data-type. In the DTV memory-reduction scenario, an overall bit-rate control completes the system, ensuring a fixed compression factor of 2-3 per frame without sacrificing the quality of the graphics},

	abstract = {Video compression is an essential task in video storage and transmission. In this paper, we worked for compressing the video sequence using Self-organizing map (SOM) and then stored the output feature vector of SOM using Hopfield Neural Network. The SOM algorithm is based on unsupervised, competitive learning. It extracts the useful features from video frames by feature extraction method. In our approach, the video sequence is first divided into video frames. The frames are processed by passing to the input of Self-organizing map (SOM) that outputs the informative features by removing some of the redundant information contained in video frames. Self-organizing map is an efficient method for reducing the size of images in the neural network field. The feature vector obtained is further used for storing the patterns using Hopfield network. The feature vector is applied to the input of the Hopfield neural network and stored in the network for encoding the video frames. Thus the compressed video frames are encoded and stored in memory as a codeword. The codeword is used for reconstruction of the video frames by using the same Hopfield network. The codeword is applied to the Self-organizing map network and the video frames are reconstructed from those codeword. Simulation results show that high compression rate is achieved while maintaining the good reconstruction quality of images.},

The first version of HEVC will be finalized by the JCT-VC in January 2013. The HEVC project was launched to achieve major savings-e.g., reduction by about half for 1,280 × 720 high-definition (HD) and higher-resolution progressives can video-for equivalent visual quality relative to the bit rate needed by the widely used H.264/ MPEG-4 Advanced Video Coding (AVC) standard. For high resolution video where such additional compression is most urgently required, implementations of the current draft standard are already meeting or exceeding the targeted goal. We review the architecture and building blocks of HEVC, which were carefully selected with regard to compression capability versus complexity and to enable parallelism for the signal processing operations. Given the benefits that HEVC provides, it is likely to become the new primary reference for video compression.},

Because of the requirements in storing the video data over a period of time for future use and because of the huge size of the raw video data, video compression technique has been integrated into the video camera of the surveillance system. As a state-of-the-art video compression technique, H.264/AVC is generally in use. However, it often leads to high computational complexity, which induces high power dissipation when a tremendous amount of cameras are installed to build a large scale of surveillance system. In this paper, a difference detection algorithm is proposed to work as a preprocessing module before video encoder to reduce the computational complexity of video compression. Because of the independency between the proposed processing and the video encoding scheme, it has high adaptability to work with any existing H.264 video encoder to save the cost in implementation and application. Experimental results demonstrate that an average of over 82\% of computational complexity reduction can be achieved by integrating the proposed algorithm either into an encoder with high complexity rate distortion optimization (RDO) coding scheme or an encoder with fast algorithm. Besides the significant reduction in computational complexity, an average of 0.06 dB improvement in PSNR is further achieved against the H.264 Main Profile with high complexity RDO coding scheme.},

	abstract = {Summary form only given. Distributed source coding has emerged as an enabling technology for sensor networks. It refers to the compression of correlated signals captured by different sensors which do not communicate between themselves. Distributed source coding finds its foundation in the seminal work of Slepian-Wolf (1973) and Wyner-Ziv (1976). The proof of the Slepian-Wolf W theorem is based on random binning, which is non-constructive, i.e., it does not reveal how practical code design should be done. In 1974, Wyner suggested the use of parity check codes to approach the corner points of the Slepian-Wolf rate region. It is only recently that practical solutions based on channel capacity-achieving codes (block codes, turbo codes or LDPC codes) have been explored for applications ranging from video compression, resilient video transmission, to minimization of transmit energy in sensor networks. Video compression, as well as scalable video compression, can be recast into a distributed source coding framework leading to distributed video coding schemes targeting mainly low coding complexity and error resilience functionalities. Correlated samples (pixels or transform coefficients) from different frames are regarded as outputs of different sensors. However, the application of the Wyner-Ziv principles to video compression is not straightforward and requires solving a number of issues. This article presents the underlying theory, the latest developments of distributed video compression and some of the research trends in the area.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel video compression technique tailored to achieve high compression ratio for synthetic and thermal video sequences while maintaining a low level of complexity. The technique relies on the segmentation of each frame into a number of regions. The contours of these regions are subsequently compressed using the entropy encoding. The high compression ratio achieved by this technique can be traded for higher temporal sampling rates to allow the representation of high mobility objects. Three types of video sequences are used to evaluate the proposed technique. These are synthetic, thermal, and real video sequences. Compression Ratio (CR) as well as Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) averaged over all frames are calculated for each type and compared to standard video compression techniques. Although the actual CR achieved is dependent on the number and size of the regions within the frame, the frame size, as well as its color representation; our results show significant improvement in CR up to twenty times the CR achieved using standard techniques. Meanwhile, the reduction in PSNR is limited. Although the relative performance of the proposed technique compared to the standard MPEG-I and MPEG-4, is maintained for all types of video sequences; the observed reconstructed video quality for synthetic and thermal videos is superior to the quality of real videos.},

	abstract = {Wireless sensor networking research has been mainly focused on internal wireless sensor network issues such as MAC and routing protocols, energy saving, HW design and to some extent on the architecture of gateways that connect a wireless sensor network with the rest of the world. Wireless sensor networks have been seen as dedicated to one task by one owner. On the other hand, our research is focused on integration of wireless sensor networks into existing networks, primarily mobile ones, and provision of sensor based and/or enhanced services to remote users. Therefore, we have been working on designing an architecture that utilizes the existing infrastructure to interconnect independent wireless sensor networks and to provide data aggregation and actuator control services. In the proposed architecture, sensor networks (small or large, deployed for any purpose and by anyone) represented by their gateways are treated as leaf nodes hanging off a mobile or fixed network that use these networks to interact with remote and local users. Each gateway exposes the capabilities of its sensors, actuators and the sensor network as a whole. This information is used by sensor services middleware to query/command sensor ecosystems on behalf of applications and remote users interested in sensor measurements or actuator control. The details of the interaction between the gateways and its sensors/actuators are of no interest to the remote users. Further, we consider the whole wireless sensor networking landscape as an open market where the underlying mobile and fixed networks facilitate the interaction between the sensor networks and the consumers of the information they produce. Each sensor network is first of all a sensor information provider that offers specific sensor information defined by the type of available sensors and their spatial and temporal conditions to the interested users. Secondly, each sensor network provides actuation services that may potentially affect the inform- ation gathered by its sensors. Obviously, in such an environment, where many mobile users are acting as tiny information providers, service discovery, service composition, service provisioning and service authorization are very challenging problems. These problems are addressed in the proposed architecture by introducing a middle layer that aggregates information from all small information providers and provides higher level services to the end users. This layer provides the means to quickly add or remove sensors, actuators, sensor networks, sensor network providers, to modify and enhance the existing or add completely new services utilizing the underlying infrastructure. It could be thought of as a "plug-and-play" functionality for: (a) interconnecting different existing sensor networks; (b) adding new sensor networks which facilitate the expansion of the entire system; and (c) expanding the capability of individual sensor networks.},

	abstract = {Multiple sensor nodes deployed in a common neighborhood to sense an event and subsequently transmit sensed information to a remote processing unit or base station, has been the recent focus of research. Tiny sensor nodes, which consist of sensing, data processing, and communicating components, leverage the idea of sensor networks based on collaborative effort of a large number of nodes. These numerous sensors are used (similar to different sensory organs in human beings) for delivering crucial information in real-time from environments and processes, where data collection is impossible previously with wired sensors [1]. Typically, wireless sensor networks are composed of low power sensor nodes and integrate general-purpose computing with heterogeneous sensing and wireless communication. Their emergence has enabled observation of the physical world at an unprecedented level of granularity. One of the most important components of a sensor node is the power unit and may be supported in most applications by a power scavenging unit such as solar cells. Hence, there is a major limitation in a wireless sensor networks, such as, the sensor nodes must consume extremely low power. Also, wireless networks are subject to various kinds of attacks and wireless communication links can be eavesdropped on without noticeable effort and communication protocols on all layers are vulnerable to specific attacks. In contrast to wire-line networks, known attacks like masquerading, man-in-the-middle, and replaying of messages can easily be carried out. Hence, a fundamental issue in the design of wireless sensor networks is the reliability i.e. how long can the wireless sensor networks survive and how well are the wireless sensor networks recovery after the malicious attacks. In this context, in this thesis, the power, mobility, and task management planes that can monitor the power, movement, and task distribution among the sensor nodes are proposed. These planes help the sensor nodes coordi- nate the sensing task and also lower the overall power consumption. In addition, a secure topology discovery algorithm is proposed and its performance is studied for different types of node distributions. The proposed work is the development of architecture for secure communication in mobile wireless networks. The approach divides the network into clusters and implements a decentralized certification authority. Decentralization is achieved using threshold cryptography and a network secret that is distributed over a number of nodes. While this basic idea has been proposed earlier partially, its application on a clustered network is a novelty.},

	abstract = {Existing work on placing additional relay nodes in wireless sensor networks to improve network connectivity typically assumes homogeneous wireless sensor nodes with an identical transmission radius. In contrast, this paper addresses the problem of deploying relay nodes to provide fault tolerance with higher network connectivity in heterogeneous wireless sensor networks, where sensor nodes possess different transmission radii. Depending on the level of desired fault tolerance, such problems can be categorized as: 1) full fault-tolerant relay node placement, which aims to deploy a minimum number of relay nodes to establish k(k ? 1) vertexdisjoint paths between every pair of sensor and/or relay nodes and 2) partial fault-tolerant relay node placement, which aims to deploy a minimum number of relay nodes to establish k(k ? 1) vertex-disjoint paths only between every pair of sensor nodes. Due to the different transmission radii of sensor nodes, these problems are further complicated by the existence of two different kinds of communication paths in heterogeneous wireless sensor networks, namely, two-way paths, along which wireless communications exist in both directions; and one-way paths, along which wireless communications exist in only one direction. Assuming that sensor nodes have different transmission radii, while relay nodes use the same transmission radius, this paper comprehensively analyzes the range of problems introduced by the different levels of fault tolerance (full or partial) coupled with the different types of path (one-way or two-way). Since each of these problems is NP-hard, we develop O(?k2)-approximation algorithms for both one-way and two-way partial fault-tolerant relay node placement, as well as O(?k3)-approximation algorithms for both one-way and two-way full fault-tolerant relay node placement (? is the best performance ratio of existing approximation algorithms for finding a minimum k-vertex connected spanning graph). To f- - acilitate the applications in higher dimensions, we also extend these algorithms and derive their performance ratios in d-dimensional heterogeneous wireless sensor networks (d ? 3). Finally, heuristic implementations of these algorithms are evaluated via QualNet simulations.},

In wireless environment these sensor nodes are defenseless or vulnerable against attacks. To solve this problem the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has been used and for wireless networks, Distributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDS) has been used. But this is not sufficient to achieve maximum resiliency against attacks. Considering the issues here a new Dynamic Intrusion Detection Protocol model (DYDOG) has been designed based on data flow for High Error Rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Here the Dynamic Intrusion Detection nodes are deployed based on the proposed protocol model which will acts as forwarding node as well as Intrusion Monitoring Node with respect to the data flow through the sensor nodes. The Dynamic Intrusion Detection Nodes are selected from the one-hop or two hop neighbor's non-forwarding node list by using Secure Session Key Management approach without deploying separate Intrusion Monitoring Nodes. This makes the network is more flexible and dynamic against various attacks and provide maximum monitoring node's availability with better resiliency in high error rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The monitoring nodes are dynamically changed in its behavior within the session itself depends on mobility and based on proposed conditions. For an attacker it will create problem to identify and attack the Dynamic Intrusion Detection Nodes within the limited session. By this protocol the attacks and compromised nodes can be effectively identified at runtime in high data rate static or dynamic Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Now the research is going on On-Line Updates for local agents and global agents individually in high data rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), when the network has maximum mobility and maximum data rate.},

	abstract = {In wireless sensor networks, micro sensor nodes dispersed in real environmental field have a constraint energy capacity, so energy-efficient mechanism for wireless communication on each sensor node is so crucial. Specially, the jobs sending and processing sensing data information from on sensor node to the others are more majority parts than merely sensing some events. Thus, energy-efficient routing protocol in wireless sensor networks is necessary for increasing the network lifetime and is also influenced by many challenging factors in terms of energy, processing, and storage capacities. In this paper, we designed and implemented a reliable energy aware routing (REAR) protocol for wireless sensor networks and evaluated the performance of REAR by comparing with existing routing protocols. REAR considers residual energy capacity of each sensor node in establishing routing paths and supports multi-path routing protocol for reliable data transmission. Furthermore, REAR allows each sensor node to confirm success of data transmission to other sensor nodes by supporting the DATA-ACK oriented packet transmission. Finally, the performance evaluation results show that REAR provides energy-efficiency and reliability related to wireless communication in wireless sensor networks.},

This article starts from the network architecture, introduces the architecture of traditional wireless sensor network, and takes account of the application scenario of mobile sensor nodes. Then we propose architecture of wireless sensor network with mobile sensor nodes. The architecture is divided into high-end node layer and low-end node layer. The high-end nodes are responsible for the data routing, and the low-end nodes are responsible for sensing and reporting data so that the mobile sensor nodes can be freed from the complicated routing calculation and implementation, and improve the network performance effectively.

Within clustering, the optimization of cluster head (CH) location is critical since CHs consume energy faster and have greater influence on lifetime than non cluster head (NCH) sensors. Energy harvesting wireless sensor networks (EH-WSNs) use energy harvesting devices to harvest energy from environment. In contrast with the traditional battery powered wireless sensor networks, EH-WSNs have extended network lifetime substantially. In this paper, we present a single cluster algorithm for lifetime optimization in homogeneous wireless sensor networks with one solar powered sensor. The proposed method could determine the optimal CH location within a given network distribution. We include the solar powered sensor node as relay node for CH and determine the optimal position for it. We evaluate the performance of our method through theoretical analysis as well as simulation.

Like IEEE 802.3 wired and IEEE 802.11 wireless networks, remote wireless sensor networks are vulnerable to malicious attacks. While wired and infrastructure-based wireless networks have mature intrusion detection systems and sophisticated firewalls to block these attacks, wireless sensor networks have only primitive defenses. WSNs rely on hardware simplicity to make sensor field deployments both affordable and long-lasting without any maintenance support. Energy-constrained sensor networks periodically place nodes to sleep in order to extend the network lifetime. Denying sleep effectively attacks each sensor node's critical energy resources and rapidly drains the network's lifetime. This paper analyzes the energy resource vulnerabilities of wireless sensor networks, models the network lifetimes of leading WSN medium access control (MAC) protocols, and proposes a new MAC protocol which mitigates many of the effects of denial of sleep attacks.},

	abstract = {A sensor network is applied to various fields from the special application fields such as wild environment monitoring, industrial machine measurement, and military-purpose measurement to the daily application fields such as fire monitoring and pollution monitoring. A Wireless Sensor Network is a wire and wireless network, which consists of several sensor nodes deployed in a certain field. A sensor node should have computation, sensing and wireless communication functions. A sensor network has a limited computing and communication resource. To overcome this barrier, collaboration with surrounding nodes is required. In other words, information sharing between hierarchies is required rather than a hierarchical approach. A sensor network generally consists of a large number of sensor nodes for exact sensing and extendibility of the sensing areas. Therefore, attackers can easily capture sensor nodes. And an attacker is able to attack the sensor node itself and the sensor network through a modified attack on sensor nodes. Therefore, the security of a sensor network is important. The attestation for sensor nodes suggested by this paper consists of 2 steps. STEP 1. Inter-connective attestation between surrounding sensor nodes STEP 2. If there is any abnormality, the node notifies the BS (Base Station) and requests attestation as to whether there is a damaged node or not. Initial sensor node attestation is carried out by inter-connective sensor nodes, not by the BS. If there is any abnormality, the node notifies the BS. And BS carries out attestation for node showing abnormality. Attestation for the BS and sensor node uses an authentication protocol method for preventing nodes from being captured. As mentioned above, because there is a periodic simple attestation procedure between sensor nodes and sensor node attestation, it is easy and rapid to identify which is captured by attacker; thus, a secure sensor network is attainable.},

	abstract = {In wireless sensor networks, owing to the limitation of energy, memory, and computation, it is necessary to construct the networks under the constraints. To save the energy, the censoring sensor that transmits information of its observations only when it is informative was proposed, and the optimal censoring region was derived so that the detection probability was maximized. The on-off sensor that is either awake or asleep (on or off) is also effective to save the observation energy. The collaboration of censoring and sleeping plays a great role in saving more energy. In this paper, we derive the mutual information in a wireless sensor network with i) censoring sensors, ii) on-off sensors, and iii) censoring and on-off sensors. Under the constraint on the average cost of each sensor, we also derive the optimum censoring and sleeping probabilities with respect to the mutual information in the sensor networks. Using the mutual information, we show that the largest mutual information in the sensor network with censoring and on-off sensors can always be achieved. We also show that the mutual information in the sensor networks with on-off sensors and with censoring and on-off sensors are larger than that in the sensor network with censoring sensors when the average cost of each sensor is small and the observation cost is large. Furthermore, we show that the largest mutual information in the sensor networks with censoring and on-off sensors and with censoring sensors can be obtained when the average cost of each sensor is not small and the observation cost is small. Based on the results, we can design very energy-efficient wireless sensor networks by using censoring and on-off sensors.},

	abstract = {A critical design issue for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is the development of medium access control (MAC) protocols that efficiently reduce power consumption. WSNs sensor nodes are generally powered by batteries which provide a limited amount of energy, and it is often difficult to recharge or replace batteries. Therefore power aware and energy efficient MAC protocols at each layer of the communications are very essential for wireless sensor networks. Fairness to both the usage of a channel and messages may also be traded as for improved power consumptions. In case of classical antennas, unfair channel allocation and wastage of channels between each node can be happened, which is directly affects throughput performance. On the other hand these can bring a problem such as MAC-deadlock, hidden and exposed terminal problem. To overcome these problems a directional antennas have been extensively used in designing MAC protocols for wireless sensor networks. Directional antennas provide many advantages over the classical antennas. These advantages include spatial reuse channel and increases in coverage range distance. One of the main considerations in designing MAC protocols for static wireless sensor networks is to reduce power consumption at the sensor nodes. This is usually done by imposing transmission and receiving schedules on the sensor nodes from only one side at same time. Since it is desirable for a sensor network to be self managed, these schedules need to be worked out by individual nodes in a distributed fashion. In this paper, we show that directional antennas can be used effectively to solve a common hidden and exposed terminal problem by using an energy efficient MAC protocol for wireless sensor networks. This directional Antenna could be rotated in case of base station node to avoid directional hidden terminal problem. Our MAC protocol conserves energy at the nodes by calculating a scheduling strategy at individual nodes and by avoiding packet collisi- - ons almost completely.},

	abstract = {Wireless industrial sensor networks are wireless sensor networks which have been adapted to industrial applications. Most techniques for wireless sensor networks can be applied to wireless industrial sensor networks. However, for industrial applications of wireless industrial sensor networks, new requirements such as real-time, reliable delivery need to be considered. In this paper, we propose EARQ, which is a novel routing protocol for wireless industrial sensor networks. It provides real-time, reliable delivery of a packet, while considering energy awareness. In EARQ, a node estimates the energy cost, delay and reliability of a path to the sink node, based only on information from neighboring nodes. Then, it calculates the probability of selecting a path, using the estimates. When packet forwarding is required, it randomly selects the next node. A path with lower energy cost is likely to be selected, because the probability is inversely proportional to the energy cost to the sink node. To achieve real-time delivery, only paths that may deliver a packet in time are selected. To achieve reliability, it may send a redundant packet via an alternate path, but only if it is a source of a packet. Experimental results show that EARQ is suitable for industrial applications, due to its capability for energy efficient, real-time, reliable communications.},

@article{6255796,
	abstract = {Wireless sensor networks are often deployed over a large area of interest and therefore the quality of the sensor signals may vary significantly across the different sensors. In this case, it is useful to have a measure for the importance or the so-called ``utility'' of each sensor, e.g., for sensor subset selection, resource allocation or topology selection. In this paper, we consider the efficient calculation of sensor utility measures for four different signal estimation or beamforming algorithms in an adaptive context. We use the definition of sensor utility as the increase in cost (e.g., mean-squared error) when the sensor is removed from the estimation procedure. Since each possible sensor removal corresponds to a new estimation problem (involving less sensors), calculating the sensor utilities would require a continuous updating of K different signal estimators (where K is the number of sensors), increasing computational complexity and memory usage by a factor K. However, we derive formulas to efficiently calculate all sensor utilities with hardly any increase in memory usage and computational complexity compared to the signal estimation algorithm already in place. When applied in adaptive signal estimation algorithms, this allows for on-line tracking of all the sensor utilities at almost no additional cost. Furthermore, we derive efficient formulas for sensor removal, i.e., for updating the signal estimator coefficients when a sensor is removed, e.g., due to a failure in the wireless link or when its utility is too low. We provide a complexity evaluation of the derived formulas, and demonstrate the significant reduction in computational complexity compared to straightforward implementations.},

	abstract = {Reliable transport protocols such as TCP are tuned to perform well in traditional networks where packet losses occur mostly because of congestion. Many applications of wireless sensor networks are useful only when connected to an external network. Previous research on transport layer protocols for sensor networks has focused on designing protocols specifically targeted for sensor networks. The deployment of TCP/IP in sensor networks would, however, enable direct connection between the sensor network and external TCP/IP networks. In this paper we focus on the performance of TCP in the context of wireless sensor networks. TCP is known to exhibit poor performance in wireless environments, both in terms of throughput and energy efficiency. To overcome these problems we introduce a mechanism called TCP segment caching .We show by simulation that TCP segment caching significantly improves TCP performance so that TCP can be useful even in wireless sensor networks.},

The handoff events occur at a much higher rate in sectored cellular networks than in traditional cellular systems. An efficient bandwidth reservation mechanism for the neighboring cells is therefore critical in the process of handoff during the connection of multimedia calls to avoid the unwillingly forced termination and waste of limited bandwidth in the sectored cellular communications, particularly when the handoff traffic is heavy. A self-adaptive bandwidth reservation scheme which employs a neural fuzzy bandwidth-reserving estimator, is proposed, and the simulation results show that our scheme can achieve superior performance than traditional fixed bandwidth-reserving scheme in sectored cellular networks when performance metrics are measured in terms of the new call blocking probability and the forced termination probability.},

Mobility of users and scarcity of bandwidth makes QoS provisioning a difficult task in cellular networks. In this paper, a call admission control (CAC) and resource reservation mechanism (RR) is described to provide a consistent QoS guarantee in cellular mobile networks and we propose an idea to improve it. This mechanism is based on user mobility profile which is effectively used for path prediction. The previous behavior of mobile users are collected and analyzed for generating mobility profiles.

	abstract = {To facilitate a viable evolution of cellular networks toward extensive packet data traffic, the High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) technology is introduced. The various link adaptation techniques employed by HSDPA augment the bandwidth variation, which is identified as one of the most important factors resulting in the deterioration of TCP performance. In this paper, we firstly build an analytical model of TCP throughput to explain why the bandwidth variation degrades the TCP performance. Subsequently, a split-connection Window Adaptation TCP Proxy is proposed to improve the TCP throughput in HSDPA networks. To use the precious cellular link resources sufficiently, the length of the queue in Node-B is intentionally kept around the reference value through adaptively adjusting the sending window size of TCP proxy based on the dynamic values of varying bandwidth. Since both the disturbance caused by bandwidth variation and the feedback delay are prone to lead an unstable queue system, the robust sliding mode variable structure control theory is employed to design the proper control law to weaken the impact of noise and delay on the stability of the queue system in Node-B. The theoretical analysis and the enhanced scheme are verified through simulation experiments. The simulation results show that our TCP proxy is able to resist against bandwidth oscillation and improve the cellular link utilization.},

Bandwidth is a scarce resource in wireless networking that needs to be carefully allocated amid competing connections with different quality of service (QoS) requirements. In this paper, an adaptive framework for supporting multiple classes of multimedia services with different QoS requirements in wireless cellular networks is proposed. The framework combines the following components: (1) a threshold-based bandwidth allocation policy that gives priority to handoff calls over new calls and prioritizes among different classes of handoff calls by assigning a threshold to each class; (2) an efficient threshold-type call admission control (CAC) algorithm; and (3) a bandwidth adaptation algorithm (BAA) that dynamically adjusts the bandwidth of ongoing multimedia calls to minimize the number of calls receiving lower bandwidth than they had requested. Numerical results show that the proposed adaptive multimedia framework outperforms existing non-adaptive schemes in terms of the handoff call dropping probability and effective utilization.},

Via QAWBA, mobile nodes form a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) using their IEEE 802.11 interfaces to share their cellular link capacity. Some mobile nodes act as proxies to contribute their idle cellular links to support a QoS request that may exceed the available bandwidth of any individual mobile node.

The inherent nature of the adaptive multimedia services allows some of the ongoing calls to undergo degrading and release some bandwidth which could be used to accommodate new calls, however, at the cost of user satisfaction. We propose a novel bandwidth allocation scheme (BAS) and CAC algorithms which could solve the conflicting relationship between user satisfaction and fairness, which could be more imperative while employing degradation policies. Specifically, we utilize a modified two-dimensional Markov chain model to analyze the proposed BAS and detail the proposed CAC algorithms integrated with a compensation mechanism based on the type of adaptive multimedia services. Moreover, in order to evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithms, we measure metrics such as blocking probability of incoming calls and bandwidth utilization rates through extensive computer simulations.

With the use of buffered bandwidth, we can balance the video workload amongst the cells to minimize the impact of overloading as the result of handoff operations.

The area of a cell is divided into non-reservation zone (NRZ), reservation zone (RZ), and handoff zone (HZ) to ensure that bandwidth is reserved in the target cell as mobile terminals (MTs) move into the RZ and leaves the NRZ. The amount of bandwidth to be reserved is dynamically adjusted according to the location and direction of MT. The performance of the system is evaluated through discrete-event simulation of a realistic cellular environment. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme reduces the new call blocking probability (NCBP), handoff call dropping probability (HCDP) and reduces the probability of terminated calls and cancel reservation based on location and current direction of MTs.

Many schemes proposed in the literature give priority to handoff calls at the expense of blocking newly originating calls and degrading channel utilization. We introduce a novel bandwidth allocation scheme based on guard policy for data handoff calls. Accordingly, if the amount of occupied bandwidth exceeds a bandwidth threshold Bt, new calls are blocked. The novelty of our scheme is based on observing the elapsed time of data handoff calls and according to a time threshold parameter, handoff calls can either be prioritized or treated as new calls. Compared with traditional well-known schemes, the simulation results show that our scheme achieves much better results on the handoff dropping probability, new call blocking probability, grade of service (GoS) and system utilization.},

	abstract = {Channel-reservation techniques have been widely studied in cellular networks in order to meet the desired quality-of-service requirements. In this paper, a distributed predictive channel-reservation scheme, called the road-map-based channel-reservation scheme (RMCR), and a call-admission-control algorithm are proposed. The goal is to reduce the handoff-dropping probability and to improve the bandwidth utilization. In the RMCR scheme, we assume that base stations (BSs) are equipped with road-map information and that mobile stations (MSs) are equipped with global positioning systems (GPS) devices. MSs periodically report their GPS location information to their BSs. Based on the location information of the MSs at two consecutive epochs, the BSs estimate the speed and moving direction of the MSs. Furthermore, the BSs estimate the probability that the MSs will enter the neighboring cells based on their velocity and the road-map information stored in the BSs. The BSs then compute the amount of bandwidth to be reserved, based on such estimation. With the road-map information, the BSs can make a more-accurate prediction on the user's mobility and, hence, reduce unnecessary bandwidth reservation. Simulation results show that RMCR is capable of keeping the handoff-dropping probability low and allocating bandwidth to new/handoff calls efficiently. We also show that RMCR is robust with respect to system parameters such as user's speed, the density of roads, the accuracy of mobility measurement, and so on.},

With the knowledge about the arrival and residence time distribution of a user in a cell, the above problem can be optimally solved using a dynamic programming based approach in polynomial time. To be able to use the solution, we provide a mechanism for constructing the arrival/residence time distribution based on the measurement of hand-off events in a cell.

We put forward a Max-Min bandwidth constraint model in which we propose a novel "use it or lend it" strategy. The new model is able to guarantee a minimum bandwidth for each CT without causing resource fragmentation. Furthermore, we design three new bandwidth preemption algorithms for three bandwidth constraint models, respectively.

When compared with the existing constraint models and preemption rules, the proposed Max-Min constraint model and preemption algorithms improve not only bandwidth efficiency, but also robustness and fairness.

Efficient bandwidth management, call admission control strategies and mobility management are important issues in supporting multiple types of services with different bandwidth requirements in hybrid networks. In particular, bandwidth is a critical commodity because of the type of transactions supported by these hybrid networks, which may have varying bandwidth and time requirements. In this paper, we consider such a problem in a hybrid wireless network installed in a superstore environment and design a bandwidth management algorithm based on the priority level, classification of the incoming transactions. Our scheme uses a downlink transaction scheduling algorithm, which decides how to schedule the outgoing transactions based on their priority level with efficient use of available bandwidth. The transaction scheduling algorithm is used to maximize the number of transaction-executions. The proposed scheme is simulated in a superstore environment with multi Rooms. The performance results describe that the proposed scheme can considerably improve the bandwidth utilization by reducing transaction blocking and accommodating more essential transactions at the peak time of the business.},

	abstract = {IEEE 802.16 WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) consists of five service classes with different priorities. The priority of real time traffic is higher than that of non-real time traffic. Since bandwidth is limited, it must be allocated in advance to guarantee the throughput of real time traffic in WiMAX network. But WiMAX standard does not provide any algorithm for dynamic allocation of bandwidth to these services. In this paper, a dynamic bandwidth allocation algorithm for WiMAX called Efficient Bandwidth Management (EBM) is proposed. In EBM the bandwidth will be increased in the upcoming frames when the allocated bandwidth is not sufficient to transfer the data. On the other side if the allocated bandwidth is more, then the bandwidth will be decreased in the upcoming frames so that the other services can use this excess bandwidth. This bandwidth increase or decrease is proportional to the remaining data in the queue. EBM increase the throughput of real time traffic as the bandwidth is handled efficiently. The proposed algorithm is implemented in ns-2 and results are compared with traditional IEEE 802.16 WiMAX. The simulation results show that EBM algorithm gives better result for real-time traffic.},

These two goals are often conflicting. Guaranteeing QoS requires traffic isolation, as well as allocation of enough network resources (e.g., buffer space and bandwidth) to each call. However, statistical bandwidth sharing means the network resources should be occupied on demand, leading to less traffic isolation and minimal resource allocation. The authors address this problem by proposing and evaluating a network-wide bandwidth management framework in which an appropriate compromise between the two conflicting goals is achieved. Specifically, the bandwidth management framework consists of a network model and a network-wide bandwidth allocation and sharing strategy. Implementation issues related to the framework are discussed.

Under the highly variable wireless environment, the existing bandwidth management schemes result in more frequent quality changes for active flows than necessary, which are undesirable and intolerant to multimedia real-time applications. The proposed scheme is designed to provide high bandwidth utilization efficiency and low call blocking probability with minimum QoS fluctuation. In order to minimize the impact of bandwidth change for the QoS of existing flows, a controlled bandwidth degradation algorithm is performed when the free bandwidth in a cell isn't enough to admit a new flow. Compared with existing schemes, our scheme reduces the probability of frequent quality changes and provides more satisfactory services for higher priority flows. The performance analysis has shown that, under the same network load, our proposed scheme outperforms existing ones with lower QoS degradation probability.},

Accurate management of bandwidth allocations with a goal of maximizing the revenues is quite complex, due to the interactions among various data flows that dynamically share the network bandwidth. We adopt a heuristics-aided control strategy that iteratively adjusts the bandwidth allocation based on the observed packet loss rate and delays. The paper first demonstrates the existence of a globally optimal operating point that minimizes the total bandwidth cost over a large number of flows while keeping the end-to-end packet delays within a prescribed limit. We then provide an algorithmic framework to search for this optimal point with an imprecise knowledge of the overall system model. Our optimization strategy for the QoS adaptation problem offers a unified management framework that considers both the bandwidth cost and the end-user QoS - and is hence useful for connectivity service providers.},

	abstract = {The residential gateway (RG) is the core device of the digital home network. The RG translates communication protocols, coordinates information sharing and serves as a gateway to external networks for integrated multimedia entertainment, on-line services, home security, home automation, information exchange and data storage. Modern home network applications especially for real-time are demanding guaranteed quality of service (QoS) for bounded network bandwidth resources. In order to initiate a DiffServ-QoS (differentiated services-QoS) bandwidth management mechanism during network congestion, this paper proposes a QRG (QoS-aware residential gateway) with both real-time traffic monitoring, DiffServ-QoS and CBQ bandwidth management. Firstly, QRG classifies traffic flow into separate types, with specialized treatment per traffic type to optimize compliance with user-specified priorities. Applications with higher priority get the right to deliver first. Additionally, QRG with built-in traffic control function adopts class based queuing (CBQ) as DiffServ-QoS bandwidth/traffic management for optimized use of bounded network resources. QRG is experimentally implemented on a Linux platform. High-end application is simulated by hosting QRG in a general-purpose PC, while minimum-cost modular application is simulated by hosting QRG in a light-weight low-power ARM920T embedded system. Results show that in both implementations, QRG successfully performs DiffServ-QoS and CBQ bandwidth management functions so that good quality of service and video performance are maintained during network congestion.},

	abstract = {As service providers move more applications to their IP/MPLS (multiple protocol label switching ) backbone networks, rapid restoration upon failure becomes more and more crucial. Recently MPLS fast reroute has attracted lots of attention as it was designed to meet the needs of real-time applications, such as voice over IP. MPLS fast reroute achieves rapid restoration by computing and signaling backup label switched path (LSP) tunnels in advance and re-directing traffic as close to failure point as possible. To provide a guarantee of bandwidth protection, extra bandwidth has to be reserved on backup paths. Using path merging technique as described in IETF RFC 4090 only, the network is able to share some bandwidth on common links among backup paths of the same service LSP, i.e., so-called intra-sharing. But no solution is provided on how to share bandwidth among backup paths of different service LSPs, i.e., so-called inter-sharing. In this paper, we provide an efficient distributed bandwidth management solution. This solution allows bandwidth sharing among backup paths of the same and different service LSPs, i.e., both intra-sharing and inter-sharing, with a guarantee of bandwidth protection for any single node/link failure. We also propose an efficient algorithm for backup path selection with the associated signaling extensions for additional information distribution and collection. To evaluate our schemes, we compare them via simulation with the basic MPLS fast reroute proposal, IETF RFC 4090, on two networks. Our simulation results show that using our bandwidth management scheme can significantly reduce restoration overbuild from about 250\% to about 100\%, and our optimized backup path selection can further reduce restoration overbuild to about 60\%.},

Our bandwidth management framework contains route computation, bandwidth allocation and preemption for label switched paths (LSPs). We put forward two algorithms. The first one, named bandwidth preemption algorithm, dedicated for the maximum allocation model and in which preemption is conducted in two dimensions: Class Type and priority levels within a same CT. Furthermore, we design a second algorithm named LSP preemption algorithm to select the most appropriate LSPs to be cast out. Selection decision is made on the basis of several criteria: the precedence level, the number of LSPs to preempt and the excess of bandwidth to gain. Extensive simulation study is carried out to evaluate the performance of our approach. Compared with existing ones, our algorithm improves not only bandwidth efficiency but also robustness and fairness. It achieves significant performance improvement for the well-behaving traffic classes in term of bandwidth link utilization, bandwidth blocking,and LSPs preemption.},

	abstract = {Distributed weighted fair scheduling schemes for QoS support in wireless networks have not yet become standard. In this paper we propose an admission control and dynamic bandwidth management scheme that provides fairness in the absence of distributed link level weighted fair scheduling. In case weighted fair scheduling becomes available, our system assists it by supplying the scheduler with weights and adjusting them dynamically as network and traffic characteristics vary. To obtain these weights, we convert the bandwidth requirement of the application into a channel time requirement. Our bandwidth manager then allots each flow a share of the channel time depending on its requirement relative to the requirements of other flows in the network. It uses a max-min fairness algorithm with minimum guarantees. The flow controls its packet transmission rate so it only occupies the channel for the fraction of time allotted to it by the bandwidth manager. As available bandwidth in the network and the traffic characteristics of various flows change, the channel time proportion allotted also dynamically varies. Our experiments show that, at the cost of a very low overhead, there is a high probability that every flow in the network will receive at least its minimum requested share of the network bandwidth.},

Due to the large number of connections, the efficient bandwidth management and related channel allocation for the uplink access in WiMAX networks is a very challenging task of the medium access control (MAC) protocol. In order to provide better bandwidth utilization and network throughput, a cost-effective WiMAX bandwidth management scheme is devised, named as the WiMAX partial sharing scheme (WPSS) and compared against a simpler scheme, named as the WiMAX complete sharing scheme (WCPS). An analytic maximum entropy (ME) model is proposed for the cost-effective performance evaluation of the two bandwidth management schemes associated with networks with a large number of stations and/or the connections. In this context, an open queueing network model (QNM) is devised, consisting of interacting queues with multiple service classes and closed form expressions for the state and blocking probability distributions are derived. Typical numerical examples are employed to verify the credibility of the analytic ME solutions against simulation results at 95\% confidence intervals. Moreover, it is shown that the WPSS can significantly improve the networks performance in comparison to that of the WCPS.},

The on-chip cache resources are limited and in many situations, cannot hold the working set of the threads running on all these cores. This situation makes DRAM bandwidth a critical shared resource. Existing DRAM bandwidth management schemes provide support for enforcing bandwidth shares but have problems like starvation, complexity, and unpredictable DRAM access latency. In this paper, we propose a DRAM bandwidth management scheme with two key features. First, the scheme avoids unexpected long latencies or starvation of memory requests. It also allows OS to select the right combination of performance and strength of bandwidth share enforcement. Second, it provides a feedback-driven policy that adoptively tunes the bandwidth shares to achieve desired average latencies for memory accesses. This feature is useful under high contention and can be used to provide performance level support for critical applications or to support service level agreements for enterprise computing data centers.},

Even with the substantial increase in the supported bandwidth in next generation Broadband Wireless Access Systems (BWASs), it is expected that these systems will severely suffer from congestion due to the rapid increase in demand of bandwidth intensive applications. Without efficient bandwidth management and congestion control schemes, network operators may not be able to meet the increasing demand of users for multimedia services, and hence they may suffer immense amount of revenue loss. In this paper, we propose an admission-level bandwidth management scheme consisting of Call Admission Control (CAC) and dynamic pricing. The main aim of our proposed scheme is to provide monetary incentives to users to use the wireless resources efficiently and rationally, hence, allowing efficient bandwidth management at the admission level. By dynamically determining the prices of units of bandwidth, the proposed scheme can guarantee that the arrival rates to the system are less than or equal to the optimal ones computed dynamically, hence, guaranteeing a congestion-free system. Simulation results show the effectiveness and strengths of our proposed approach.},

The tutorial describes the needs for the three types of policy rules: class-based bandwidth limitation, session-bandwidth guarantee, and inter/intra-class bandwidth borrowing. The survey portion investigates how the eight chosen commercial/open-source real systems enforce the three policy types. To evaluate the techniques, the designed testbed emulates real-life Internet conditions, such as many simultaneous sessions from different IPs/ports, controllable wide area network (WAN) delay and packet loss rate for each session, and different TCP source implementations. The performance metrics include accuracy of bandwidth management, fairness among sessions, robustness under Internet packet losses and different operating systems, inter/intra-class bandwidth borrowing, and voice over IP (VoIP) quality. The black-box test results demonstrate that (1) only the combination of CBQ+PFQ+TCR can solve the most difficult scenario (multiple sessions competing for the narrow 20kb/s class); (2) the TCR approach may degrade the goodput, fairness, and compatibility even under slight packet loss rates (0.5 percent); (3) without PFQ, TCR and RED have limited ability to isolate the sessions (especially for RED); (4) the G.729 VoIP quality over a 125kb/s access link becomes good only after exercising MSS-clamping to shrink the packet size of the background traffic down to 256 byte.},

	abstract = {The Internet architecture uses congestion avoidance mechanisms implemented in the transport layer protocol like TCP to provide good service under heavy load. If network nodes distribute bandwidth fairly, the Internet would be more robust and accommodate a wide variety of applications. Various congestion and bandwidth management schemes have been proposed for this purpose and can be classified into two broad categories: packet scheduling algorithms such as fair queueing (FQ) which explicitly provide bandwidth shares by scheduling packets. They are more difficult to implement compared to FIFO queueing. The second category has active queue management schemes such as RED which use FIFO queues at the routers. They are easy to implement but don't aim to provide (and, in the presence of non-congestion-responsive sources, don't provide) fairness. An algorithm called AFD (approximate fair dropping), has been proposed to provide approximate, weighted max-min fair bandwidth allocations with relatively low complexity. AFD has since been widely adopted by the industry. This paper describes the evolution of AFD from a research project into an industry setting, focusing on the changes it has undergone in the process. AFD now serves as a traffic management module, which can be implemented either using a single FIFO or overlaid on top of extant per-flow queueing structures and which provides approximate bandwidth allocation in a simple fashion. The AFD algorithm has been implemented in several switch and router platforms at Cisco sytems, successfully transitioning from the academic world into the industry.},

Considering a GSM 900 based cellular multimedia network model, the dependency of system efficiency on the diversity of multimedia calls and handoff rate is first established; then, having determined an optimized value of protection ratio, it is established that, regardless of protection ratio value, the system's capacity depends upon the employed MAC (medium access control) protocol and handoff rate. Having confirmed numerical results by using LABVIEW 6.0 simulation software, it is concluded that, for any desired QoS level, the cellular multimedia network management requires intelligent optimization of the system efficiency and the system capacity that also depends on the employed MAC protocol and handoff rate.},

The cellular neural network is powerful for complicated optimization problems and implementable by circuits with rapid convergence to a desired equilibrium; the utility-based scheduling algorithm can efficiently utilize the radio resource for system and provide QoS requirements and fairness for connections. A relevant utility function for each connection is here defined as its radio resource function further weighted by both a QoS requirement deviation function and a fairness compensation function. The CNNU-based scheduler determines a radio resource assignment vector for all connections so that the overall system utility is maximized and the system throughput can be achieved as high as possible. At the same time, the performance measures of all connections are kept closed to their QoS requirements in an efficient way.},

In proposed scheme, multimedia services include voice and data calls and the bandwidth threshold for non-prioritized handoff multimedia calls and new multimedia calls can be varied adaptively based on handoff and new multimedia call arrival rates. This makes it possible that there are the increasing numbers of new multimedia calls and non-prioritized handoff multimedia calls which can successfully occupies bandwidth units in ATTSM when carried traffic is heavier. The ATTSM increases service provider satisfaction by improving the bandwidth utilizations at the cost of increasing the prioritized multimedia handoff call dropping probabilities that may tolerate uncritical dropping compared with Fixed Time-Threshold-based bandwidth allocation Scheme (FTTSM). Simulation results validate the superiority of ATTSM over FTTSM. Hence, the proposed scheme provides good QoS guarantees for both mobile multimedia users and the service provider.},

The code division multiple access system with time division duplex mode (TDD-CDMA), adopting unbalanced slot allocation between uplink and downlink, is a good solution for this traffic asymmetry. Here a QoS adaptive multimedia service framework is proposed to control the multimedia traffic in TDD-CDMA cellular wireless networks. The scheme operates at the connection-level where the CDMA code of ongoing call can be dynamically changed to provide an acceptable trade off level between connection blocking and dropping probabilities for different traffic class. The proposed scheme is designed to take advantage of the adaptive code allocation algorithm in order to enhance the system utilization, and blocking \& dropping probabilities of calls. Although orthogonal variable frequency spreading (OVSF) code is used in simulation here, the paramount interest is on algorithm that allows optimum use of TDD-CDMA resources i.e. code and time slots. Simulation result shows that on the expense of resource allocated to non real-time services, the call dropping and blocking rate for real-time services can be minimized.},

However, neither the media-handling architectures currently in use in conventional cellular networks, nor the ones in use in MANETs are appropriate. When they are used, either the participants in the conventional cellular network, or the ones in the MANETs, might experience long and potentially unacceptable end-to-end stream delays. Furthermore, these architectures are the antipodes of each other. Reconciling them is not an easy task. We evaluate the architectures currently in use in cellular networks and MANETs, show that none is suitable, and propose a new architecture that bridges the two worlds. The new architecture uses the MANET media-handling architectures as a starting point. It is based on media mediators. A media mediator is composed of two functional entities: the media gateway controller mediator and the media gateway mediator. A proof-of-concept prototype was implemented, and extensive simulations were conducted to evaluate performance.},

The analytical model is based on continuous-time multidimensional birth-death processes, and it is focused on just one of the cells in the network. The cellular system is assumed to provide three classes of service: the basic voice service, a data service with bit rate higher than the voice service and a multimedia service with one voice and one data component. In order to improve the overall network performance, some channels can be reserved to handovers, and multimedia calls that cannot complete a handover are decoupled, by transferring to the target cell only the voice component and suspending the data connection until a sufficient number of channels becomes free. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of the approximate model, as well as the effectiveness of the newly proposed multimedia call decoupling approach},

In this paper we consider a similar adaptive framework, and devise call admission control and bandwidth allocation strategies to serve multimedia connections in a CDMA-based 3G cellular network. The architecture aims at maintaining the session's quality during both intra-cell and inter-cell user movements by limiting the cell overload probability. A novel aspect of our work is a method for exploiting a priori knowledge of user mobility patterns to estimate the cell overload probability after some prescribed prediction interval. Important properties of the devised method are proved analytically.

Unlike other model-based algorithms, our scheme does not require explicit state transition probabilities and therefore the assumptions behind the underlying system model are more realistic than those in previous schemes. Moreover, by considering the status of neighboring cells, the proposed scheme can dynamically adapt to changes in traffic condition. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in adaptive multimedia cellular networks},

Therefore, the demand for effective management of the resources is immensely needed to enhance the network performance. In this paper, adaptive resource allocation scheme based call admission control (CAC) and mobility prediction for controlling the multimedia traffic in the network to enhance the previous schemes which are reduce the handoff call dropping probability (HCDP) through an adaptive multimedia schemes with more accurate mobility prediction. However, the new calls have not been able to take advantage of the adaptive scheme and thus new call blocking probability (NCBP) has not improved as much. Therefore, the proposed scheme is designed to take advantage of the adaptive resource allocation scheme with new and handoff calls rather than only handoff call in order to enhance the system utilization and the NCBP. The simulation results show the performance of proposed scheme outperforms the compared scheme in terms of NCBP and bandwidth utilization.},

Our algorithm alters a mobile host's straight moving paths into Delta-shaped camouflaging paths, which cause its wireless transmissions to be distributed over a large area, and hence, reduce the probability of generating traceable wireless transmissions. Furthermore, on the premise of not affecting the mobile hosts' itineraries, our collaborated mobility algorithm clusters the motion paths of mobile hosts to make it difficult for an adversary to identify the mobile hosts. We model the objective of maximizing mobility privacy and minimizing the overhead (e.g. the extra travel distance) as a nonlinear constrained optimization problem and use the solution to the optimization problem as the collaborated mobility. Lastly, we analyze the calculation time of the collaborated camouflaging mobility and conduct simulations to evaluate the privacy improvements brought by the collaborated camouflaging mobility algorithm compared with non-covered mobility.},

Naturally, not every service will be available for free, some providers will charge money for the services provided. Usually, users are uniquely identified by the provider of a service for billing purposes and providers therefore maintain user profiles. This allows to personalize services with respect to user's interests and preferences. However, it is problematic regarding user's privacy since users disclose lots of sensitive information to the service provider. Different mobile payment solutions have been proposed to date, but privacy aspects are usually not considered at all. In this paper, we demonstrate how privacy friendly payment can be realized using a recent payment mechanisms in combination with an ARM processor platform with TrustZone enhancements. We discuss the public transport ticket domain as an example. Then we propose a platform framework that can be used for arbitrary applications requiring a privacy preserving online remote prepaid payment system suitable for micro as well as macro payments.},

We then propose a scheme that meets these requirements, and this scheme does not introduce security vulnerability to the underlying authentication scheme.

Social interaction and data sharing - being essential aspects of distributed collaborative applications - typically result in conflicting goals, primarily awareness vs. privacy. Preserving the end users' privacy especially in mobile collaborative settings is the most often-cited point of critique of mobile and ubiquitous computing. Since usability is a prerequisite for privacy and awareness mechanisms especially for mobile applications, we report in this paper on how to balance usability, privacy, and awareness trade-offs when building mobile collaborative applications. This is complemented by new approaches for preserving privacy tailored to the needs of respective communities in the domain of decentralized group-centric solutions. The requirements were gathered through an analysis of user's needs as well as first evaluations of prototypes. Those were built for different case studies focusing on privacy, trust, and identity management in real-life communities.

Privacy protection is of great importance for such service users in mobile and wireless networks. However, as mobile devices are highly autonomous and heterogeneous, it is challenging to design generic protection techniques and achieve high level of privacy protection. Our study focuses on both potential privacy threats and privacy preserving mechanisms in mobile ad hoc networks. Preliminary work shows that the proposed system architecture and protection mechanisms exhibit satisfactory performance. The remaining work for completing the PhD dissertation is then presented. The proposed research carries significant intellectual merits and potential broader impacts in the following aspects. (1) We investigate the impact of inferential attacks on LBS users in mobile and wireless networks, and prove the vulnerability of using long-term pseudonyms for camouflaging users' real identities. (2) We propose a novel privacy metric to quantify system's resilience to such attack models. (3) An effective and extensible privacy architecture based on the mix zone model is designed. (4) We conduct rigorous analytical study, and design a privacy protection mechanism under real world constraints, e.g., traffic density and heterogeneity on different roads.

Also, even if the location is exposed willingly by the mobile client the query should not be linked to the mobile client. Still, many location based systems (store finders, transit itinerary systems, and social networks) are created with a different focus and have little concern for end user privacy. We focused on location based mobile systems where the location of the mobile user may be available; however, an adversary should not be able to link a query to a specific mobile user. Two key contributions of this work are the introduction and experimental evaluation of a novel concept called transportation mode homogeneity anonymization that adds another dimension to privacy in mobile location based systems. Also, a novel dynamic layered approach on achieving K-anonymity by separating the local privacy requirement on each snapshot and global privacy requirement across snapshots with different privacy goals is proposed to exploit the local privacy anonymization group as candidates to obtain global anonymization group candidates.},

	abstract = {Privacy requirements for mobile applications offer a distinct set of challenges for requirements engineering. First, they are highly dynamic, changing over time and locations, and across the different roles of agents involved and the kinds of information that may be disclosed. Second, although some general privacy requirements can be elicited a priori, users often refine them at runtime as they interact with the system and its environment. Selectively disclosing information to appropriate agents is therefore a key privacy management challenge, requiring carefully formulated privacy requirements amenable to systematic reasoning. In this paper, we introduce privacy arguments as a means of analysing privacy requirements in general and selective disclosure requirements (that are both content- and context-sensitive) in particular. Privacy arguments allow individual users to express personal preferences, which are then used to reason about privacy for each user under different contexts. At runtime, these arguments provide a way to reason about requirements satisfaction and diagnosis. Our proposed approach is demonstrated and evaluated using the privacy requirements of BuddyTracker, a mobile application we developed as part of our overall research programme.},

Mobile banking is one such innovation that has afforded banking clients the ability to, amongst other services, view bank statements, pay bills, and transfer money. Despite a growing trend in mobile banking service offerings by SA banks, privacy and security issues are still considered a concern. The paper conceptualizes the underlying concerns by bank clients regarding the adoption of mobile banking services. Privacy Calculus Theory (PCT) has been used as a theoretical lens to explain the cognitive process involved when a potential mobile banking subscriber is presented with mobile banking technology solutions. The paper extends PCT by abstracting the risk/benefit trade-off psyche held by SA bank clients. The paper attempts to explain, using PCT, the bank clients' cognitive process and willingness to subscribe to mobile banking services. Quantitative research method has been used for this purpose. Purposeful sampling that targeted SA bank-account holders was applied. Empirical results show that the South African banked consumers' psyche is largely influenced by the utility of a technology (mobile banking service) and interestingly, privacy and security play a lesser role in this trade-off.},

	abstract = {Mobile telephony (e.g., Global System for Mobile Communications [GSM]) is today's most common communication solution. Due to the specific characteristics of mobile communication infrastructure, it can provide real added value to the user and various other parties. Location information and mobility patterns of subscribers contribute not only to emergency planning, general safety, and security, but are also a driving force for new commercial services. However, there is a lack of transparency in today's mobile telephony networks regarding location disclosure. Location information is generated, collected, and processed without being noticed by subscribers. Hence, by exploiting subscriber location information, an individual's privacy is threatened. We develop a utility-based opponent model to formalize the conflict between the additional utility of mobile telephony infrastructure being able to locate subscribers and the individual's privacy. Based on these results, measures were developed to improve an individual's location privacy through a user-controllable GSM software stack. To analyze and evaluate the effects of specific subscriber provider interaction, a dedicated test environment will be presented, using the example of GSM mobile telephony networks. The resulting testbed is based on real-life hardware and open-source software to create a realistic and defined environment that includes all aspects of the air interface in mobile telephony networks and thus, is capable of controlling subscriber-provider interaction in a defined and fully controlled environment.},

This creates the conditions and motivation for a mobile electronic ID system, preferably one which provides a friendly privacy solution. The existing mobile identification solutions place the interviewer in a more authoritative position than the interviewee, while little or no privacy control is applied by the interviewee. With the mobile ID system (MobIS), this paper proposes a universal mobile ID system which is suitable for various scenarios (e.g. for professional, medical, or official uses) in a heterogeneous network environment. Such systems are highly prone to security and privacy threats, so a context aware privacy mechanism is developed in the proposed framework. The security and privacy frameworks are elaborated, and a demonstration of the prototype is presented in this paper.},

Privacy in location based systems is addressed in many papers. Our work is focused on the trusted third party privacy framework that utilizes the concept of k-anonymity with or without l-diversity. In previous anonymization models k may be defined as a personalization parameter of the mobile user or as uniform system parameter for all mobile users . Clearly, k other users may not be available at the time of request in these systems. These requests are discarded because the quality of service (QoS) they require cannot be satisfied. In this paper we introduce a novel suite of algorithms called MobiPriv that guarantees a 100\% success rate of processing a mobile request using k-anonymity with diversity considerations. We evaluated our suite of algorithms experimentally against previously proposed anonymization algorithms using real world traffic volume data, real world road network and mobile users generated realistically by a mobile object generator.},

	abstract = {Mobile devices are becoming the largest sensor network around the world. They could be used to collect a large amount of data with little effort and cost which is leading to a promising future for participatory sensing networks or urban sensing. However, privacy concerns of the mobile users are the major inhibitors hindering massive participation. This paper proposes a solution to user privacy preserving problem in a participatory sensing network. Each user is considered as a node in a social network and users are connected through friendship links which are represented as edges on the network. Typically, each user contributes to the participatory system by uploading his/her acquired data to a server. Instead of uploading data to the server directly, we devised a Hot-Potato-Privacy-Protection Algorithm (H P3) in which data is sent to one of the friends of the user and the friend will choose another friend to deliver the data to the next hop. Hopping goes on until some user-defined threshold is reached, then the last user uploads the data to the server. Friend selection is random and the number of hops is also random and independent. H P3 ensures that the probability that the server can make a successful attack on the data owner is no better than 1/n where n is the number of mobile users in the system. Therefore, H P3 protects location privacy as well as data ownership privacy of mobile users. We simulate our approach on some large scale social networks and report some findings in the paper. Experiments show that our system achieves privacy protection for each user against the server with tolerable communication overhead.},

	abstract = {With the growing demand for data-sensitive applications employing mobile devices, such as mobile clinics in remote villages and remote sensors collecting sensitive data, there is a need for a new architectural paradigm for mobile data management. Typically, these mobile devices have limited storage and processing capabilities, and operate in unreliable environments leading to possible loss of valuable data, if not properly managed. Often, the collected data is periodically offloaded to a remote server such as a cloud. However, such offloading may lead to violation of privacy if the network/server cannot be fully trusted. While encrypting the data prior to offloading appears to be a solution for this problem, this is computationally intensive and infeasible when mobile devices are employed. In this paper, we propose a partial-encryption scheme that takes into account both the privacy (confidentiality) constraints of the data being collected and the limitations of the mobile devices. The scheme employs vertical and horizontal fragmentation to determine those parts that need to be encrypted and those that can be sent in clear. The privacy constraints are represented in terms of a constraint graph and two-coloring problem solution is applied to identify the portions of the data that need to be encrypted. Any cycles in the constraint graph are handled using heuristics. The approach is effective in integrating unsecured wireless/internet with the untrusted yet cheap cloud storage servers, using the capacity-constrained mobile devices to manage sensitive data.},

However, location privacy protection is particularly challenging: on one hand, the administration requires all legitimate users to provide identity information in order to grant them permission to use its wireless service; on the other hand, mobile users would prefer not to expose any information that could enable anyone, including the administration, to get some clue regarding their whereabouts; mobile users would like to have complete personal control of their location privacy. To address this issue, we propose an authorized-anonymous-ID-based scheme; this scheme effectively eliminates the need for a trusted server or administration, which is assumed in the previous work. Our key weapon is a cryptographic technique called blind signature, which is used to generate an authorized anonymous ID that replaces the real ID of an authorized mobile device. With authorized anonymous IDs, we design an architecture capable of achieving complete personal control over location privacy while maintaining the authentication function required by the administration.},

	abstract = {As Internet protocol (IP)-based protocols move toward becoming the prevalent means for providing new forms of communication, for example, using IP for communication traditionally done via public Switched telephone network (PSTN), location privacy of mobile end users becomes an important problem to address. In an IP network, each packet carries IP addresses corresponding to the source (sender) and the destination (receiver) of the packet. Mobile hosts (laptop computers, PDAs, mobile phones etc.) usually acquire temporary IP addresses from the address spaces allocated to the access networks where they are currently connected to the Internet, and use these addresses for communication over the Internet. Due to a strong correlation between the address spaces used by the access networks and the geographic location of the access networks, location privacy of mobile users is compromised. If the recipient or an intermediate network node in the path of the packet analyzes the packet, the location of the sender of the packet is revealed. This may affect the widespread acceptance of IP based protocols. In this paper we present a novel protocol called LocPriv that preserves the location privacy in an IP based mobile communication network. The protocol works by employing an IP address encapsulation/swapping scheme at the access nodes to conceal the IP address of the mobile host, without affecting the route that the packets should follow in the network. We compare the protocol with existing techniques for providing location privacy and also analyze the effect of the protocol on the complexity of routing elements.},

People can use the mobile phone cameras to capture QR code at the corner of web page, and then the hyperlink corresponding to the QR code can be accessed instantly. Since QR code looks like random noise and it occupies a corner of the original image, its existence can greatly reduce the value of the original content. Thus, how to retain the value of original image, while keeping the capability for the instant access for webpages, would be the major concern of this paper. With the aid of our reversible data hiding technique, the QR codes can be hidden into the original image, and considerable increase in embedding capacity can be expected. Next, we propose a scheme such that when the image containing the QR code is browsed, the hyperlink corresponding to the QR code is accessed first. Then, the QR code could get vanished and the original image would be recovered to retain the information conveyed therein.

To recognize a QR-code correctly and stably, the resolution of an input image should be high. In practice, however, recognition of a QR-code is usually difficult due to low resolution when it is captured from a distance. In this paper, we propose a method to improve the performance of low resolution QR-code recognition by using the super-resolution technique that generates a high resolution image from multiple low-resolution images. Although a QR-code is a binary pattern, it is observed as a grayscale image due to the degradation through the capturing process. Especially the pixels around the borders between white and black regions become ambiguous. To overcome this problem, the proposed method introduces a binary pattern constraint to generate super-resolved images appropriate for recognition. Experimental results showed that a recognition rate of 98\% can be achieved by the proposed method, which is a 15.7\% improvement in comparison with a method using a conventional super-resolution method.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a system for decorating QR code, the most popular two-dimensional barcode in Japan, with a facial image by Interactive Evolutionary Computation (IEC). QR code uses Reed-Solomon code which has error correction function, so a few images can be put on some appropriate positions of the code without damaging the implanted information; however it is hard to find such appropriate positions because they depend on QR code instances and images. The proposed system allows a user to capture his/her facial image with ease, to encode a sentence into a QR code, and to find good positions for the facial image on the code. Furthermore, the proposed system enables the user to choose the most desired design by iteratively selecting candidates the system displays. A simple experiment has shown that the proposed system makes a QR code decorated with a facial image within 10 to 20 minutes involving the time when a user thinks the implanted message and chooses a color.},

The 2D Barcode with a digital watermark is a widely interesting research in the security field. In this paper propose a video watermarking with text data (verification message) by using the Quick Response (QR) Code technique. The QR Code is prepared to be watermarked via a robust video watermarking scheme based on the (singular value decomposition)SVD and (Discrete Wavelet Transform)DWT. In addition to that logo (or) watermark gives the authorized ownership of video document. SVD is an attractive algebraic transform for watermarking applications. SVD is applied to the cover I-frame. The extracted diagonal value is fused with logo (or) watermark. DWT is applied on SVD cover image and QR code image. The inverse transform on watermarked image and add the frame into video this watermarked (include logo and QR code image) the video file sends to authorized customers. In the reverse process check the logo and QR code for authorized ownership. These experimental results can achieved acceptable imperceptibility and certain robustness in video processing.},

	abstract = {Since the introduction of QR Codes in the 90's, many companies have developed QR Code generators and mobile applications to read QR Codes. Despite the obvious benefits of next-generation data transfers, they have yet to be widely accepted and practiced. One of the main reasons is the use of unique language characters such as Arabic characters, Japanese Kanji, Thai Abugida and so forth. An attempt at embedding Arabic characters into QR Code for example, will result in the character's Unicode representation to be automatically encoded and/or decoded by default, instead of the original alphabet as a result of a method called Romanization. Thus, the intended use of the generated code has been useless. It is also noted that Romanization causes each character to be encoded in its own unique codeword which devours more space than encoding it with codeword for character combinations. In order to help solve this problem, this paper proposes the use of an algorithm that compares each word from an Arabic input with an internal codeword library that will then select the shortest codeword possible for single character and two-character combinations to replace the default Unicode representation, which also serves as a space saving method that allows longer messages to be encoded in a single QR Code. In return, the same method is also used to properly decode the message.},

It is still a major problem about feature recognition in complex background and uneven intensity of light environment. Some researchers have already achieved in particular conditions. With the robot stepping into family, it is necessary to conduct in-depth study about feature recognition and access to information in complex indoor environmental conditions. In this paper, we present a fast identification approach for QR code in the indoor environment with normal light intensity. In the process of image feature recognition, it is very difficult for the edge while recognizing the slope image. Therefore, we use vector method to express the color characteristics in the image, and use the square minimum method to determine the edge lines of the pattern. In addition, linear scale transformation makes the image pattern more suitable for standard grids, which can correct the tiny sampling error. Besides, in the experiment of emulation process, we add a colored periphery features to positioning the image. It can be captured clearly due to the special colored background and behave well in the distance of 0.5m to 2m. Using an 860-pixel distance camera, the QR code pattern can be captured easily and identified effectively. A feedback control planar mobile robot is used as a platform to verify the identification method. After the robot heading to the front of the QR code pattern about 0.5m, the data of the sample image can be scanned and read accurately. The experiment results show that the approach is feasible and effective.},

	abstract = {A 2D color barcode can hold much more information than a binary barcode. Barcodes are often intended for consumer use where using a cellphone, a consumer can take an image of a barcode on a product, and retrieve relevant information about the product. The barcode must be read using computer vision techniques. While a color barcode can hold more information, it makes this vision task in consumer scenarios unusually challenging. We present our approach to the localization and segmentation of a 2D color barcode in such challenging scenarios, along with its evaluation on a diverse collection of images of Microsoft's recently launched high capacity color barcode (HCCB). We exploit the unique trait of barcode reading: the barcode decoder can give the vision algorithm feedback, and develop a progressive strategy to achieve both - high accuracy in diverse scenarios as well as computational efficiency.},

	abstract = {With a camera mobile phone, which has become a "must-have" device, 2D-barcode works as an interface to bridge the physical and digital world. As the notion of ubiquitous computing has permeated, developing a new 2D-barcode and its applications has been a growing trend worldwide. A 2D-barcode symbol consists of two broad areas: data area and guide area. The components of the latter is collectively called "finder pattern" and used in locating the 2D-barcode symbol. The failure of finding the target symbol prevents a barcode reader from successfully decoding the barcode. Hence, designing a functional finder pattern is one of the key for improving the robustness of barcode reading, and thus, the entire 2D-barcode system. We have designed a novel finder pattern integrated with a color 2D-barcode for camera mobile phone applications. Through the development and evaluation of the finder pattern for effective color 2D-barcode detection, this paper discusses keys to improve the functionality and reliability of finder patterns, which should be kept in mind when designing a finder pattern for any 2D-barcode symbol.},

	abstract = {Two dimensional (2D) barcodes are becoming a pervasive interface for mobile devices, such as camera smart phones. Often, only monochrome 2D-barcodes are used due to their robustness in an uncontrolled operating environment of smart phones. Nonetheless, we are seeing an emerging use of color 2D-barcodes for camera smart phones. Most smart phones capture and store such 2D-barcode images in the baseline JPEG format. As a lossy compression technique, JPEG does introduce a fair amount of error in the captured 2D-barcode images. In this paper, we analyzed the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficient distributions of generalized 2D-barcodes using colored data cells, each comprising of 4, 8 and 10 colors. Using these DCT distributions, we improved the JPEG compression of such mobile barcode images. By altering the JPEG compression parameters based on the DCT coefficient distribution of the barcode images, our improved compression scheme produces JPEG images with higher PSNR value as compared to the baseline implementation. We have also applied our improved scheme to a 10 colors 2D-barcode system; and analyzed its performance in comparison to the default and alternative JPEG schemes. We have found that our improved scheme does provide a marked improvement for the successful decoding of the 10 colors 2D-barcode system.},

A number of common problems are encountered in the process of scanning and decoding barcode, such as various types of noise, blur, uneven lighting, and in particular the presence of extraneous information surrounding the image. In this paper we introduce a new 2D barcode namely HoloBarcode. The proposed barcode is developed as a computer generated hologram (CGH). Exploiting the ownerships of the holography, this new 2D barcode is able to provide the embedded information even in the presence of damaged surface. In particular, HoloBarcode is particularly robust in presence of extraneous information overlapping the image. For these reasons, this new barcode can be a valid alternative in all those applications where we have possibility of "important" damages of the code itself. Measurements of robustness to such manipulations were made, on 2D HoloBarcode against the popular Data Matrix code. Comparisons between the two different 2D Barcodes are highlighted.},

The different types of codes and applications impose special problems, so there is a continuous need for solutions with improved effectiveness. There are several methods for barcode localization, that are well characterized by accuracy and speed. Particularly, high-speed processing places need automatic barcode localization, e.g. conveyor belts, automated production, where missed detections cause loss of profit. In this paper, we mainly deal with segmentation of images with 1D barcode, but also analyze the operation of different methods for 2D barcode images as well. Our goal is to detect automatically, rapidly and accurately the barcode location by the help of extracted features. We compare some published method from the literature, which basically rely on the contrast between the background and the shape that represent the code. We also propose a novel algorithm, that outperforms the others in both accuracy and efficiency in detecting 1D codes.},

Barcode, which is simple but contains much information, has been used in navigation, manufacture and other situations by robots. Reading a barcode based on image analysis is an essential technique for such a robot system. Unfortunately, few existing image analysis methods about it are capable of identifying the codes under uncertain conditions, such as varying illumination, different sizes or orientations. This paper presents a method which can locate barcode region at an uncertain 3-D background through hierarchically extracting the distinct features of it with a high precision even for the broken, aberrant, partly blotted out stripes and other poor qualities of images. The method begins with a barcode quality assessment, in which a set of omnidirectional scan lines (active set lines) and a set of description of the whole image (resembling barcode measure), are defined. According to RBM, a series of corresponding methods are chosen to have a pre-processing process of the image and decode the codes respectively. The experiment results prove that our proposed method has two main characteristics. One is fast to locate barcode (get ROI of barcode). The other is to read barcode under unpredicted conditions robustly},

The system using a six-line ternary barcode and a six-mirror-facet raster scanner was demonstrated to be capable of providing detection in a wide detection range of over 3.5 cm at a scanning speed of 417 scan/sec, over eight times that of conventional CCD cameras. The allowable skew angle for detection of barcode was over -16 ~ +16 degrees, which are nearly equivalent to that in the conventional two-dimensional barcode detection system. The possibility of high-speed detection with a sufficient detection range determined by the raster scanner configuration and a practically usable large allowable skew angle for barcode detection was confirmed even when the scanning lines were increased.

Barcode decoding systems usually fail to decode barcodes from an image that is affected by image blurring. With macro function, users are able to capture sharp barcodes. Unfortunately, low end and mid range cameras usually do not have macro function which enables close range image capturing. To improve barcode recognition, we propose a technique to restore barcode images before the decoding process. First, we identify and calculate the point spread function (PSF) parameter and radius of the blur in Cepstrum domain. Then we restore the degraded image using Wiener filter. Experiments on both synthetic and real images show that our technique is adept in estimating the radius of the blur. The Wiener filter gives satisfactory result when it is used to restore blurred images with the acquired PSF from the preceding step.},

The mobile phone system used here consists of a camera, mobile application processor, digital signal processor (DSP), and display device, and the source image is captured by the embedded camera device. The introduced algorithm is based on the code area found by four corners detection for 2D barcode and spiral scanning for 1D barcode using the embedded DSP. This algorithm is robust for practical situations and the DSP has good enough performance for the real-time recognition of the codes. The performance of our image processing is 66.7 frames/sec for EAN code and 14.1 frames/sec for QR code image processing, and this is sufficient performance for practical use. The released mobile phone had performance of 5-10 frames/sec including OS and subsystem overheads.},

Here we choose a specific problem in which the image is a barcode and the motion can be modeled as a convolution. We design a blind deconvolution algorithm to remove the translatory motion from a blurred barcode image. Based on the bimodal characteristics of barcode image histograms, we construct a simple target function that measures how similar a deconvoluted image is to a barcode. We minimize this target function over the set of possible convolution kernels to find the most likely blurring kernel. By restricting our search to dome-shaped kernels (first monotonously increasing and then monotonously decreasing) we decrease the number of false solutions. We have tried our system on a collection of a 138 barcode images with varying camera blur, and the recognition rate increases from 32\% to 65\%.},

However, depending on the combination of the target paper media, the ink used in the media, and the invisible ink, we cannot always correctly decode the information. In this paper, we introduce a new 2D barcode encoding and decoding method which overcomes such problems. In our method, we divide the 2D code data area into several blocks, and do not use for encoding the blocks where many of the bits in the block have high probabilities of bit errors. The decoder determines the skipped blocks from the image itself. The experimental results proved that our method greatly improved the probability of correct information decoding for the invisible barcode.},

	abstract = {The RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) is considered as one of the most preferable ways for the position estimation in indoor environments, since GPS does not work in such situations. In RFID system, an RFID reader enables to estimate the position of RFID tags easily and inexpensively. In applications with the position estimation of RFID tags, indoor robot navigations are very important for human society. The problem is how to obtain the position estimations of RFID tags as accurately as possible. Previously S-CRR (Swift Communication Range Recognition) has been proposed for the appropriate estimation method of this kind of applications. This method is capable of the accurate position estimation of an RFID tag in very short time. The disadvantage of S-CRR is that the mobile robot must stop to search RFID tags accurately at each position. In indoor robot navigations, mobile entities like robots have to move continuously because they need to navigate smoothly and safely. In this paper, we propose a new position estimation method of RFID tags with continuous moving only using RFID technology. We call this Continuous Moving CRR (CM-CRR). CM-CRR uses two communication ranges, long and short ranges and switches them appropriately. The system estimates the position of RFID tags using their approaches and continuous moving. To show the effectiveness of CM-CRR, we evaluate the estimation error of an RFID tag by computer simulations. From the results, CM-CRR can accurately estimate the position of RFID tags with continuously moving of the mobile robot and be applied to indoor robot navigations.},

	abstract = {Technology-driven transactions, or e-commerce, should not involve a tradeoff in which consumers relinquish widening amounts of their privacy in return for greater convenience. Businesses that put customers in control of their online privacy options increase consumer faith in the online world - and promote greater acceptance of e-commerce. Ultimately, though, the issue comes down to consumer empowerment and trust. ``Companies rolling out RFID must have a clear and rigidly enforced policy on the deactivation of their tracking mechanisms, as having a cost-effective supply chain will be pretty meaningless if nobody trusts you enough to buy from you,'' states Martin Butler. RFID is rapidly pushed to the existing markets with diversified applications, such as automatic tariffs payment in public transport, animal identification and tracking, and automated manufacturing and logistics control. Unprotected communications between tags and readers over a wireless channel can disclose information about the tags and their positions. Due to the potential wide deployment of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), the security of RFID systems has drawn extensive attention from both academia and industry, and the RFID authentication protocol is an important mechanism in the security of RFID systems. The desired security requirements of RFID authentication protocols include privacy, integrity, authentication, anonymity/untraceability, and even availability. To design an efficient protocol that satisfies all the requirements with limited resources is a challenge According to Benoit Calmels et.al - 2006 -Strong cryptography mechanisms need high computing resources which is not possible to be embedded into RFID tags. The approach would be an implementation of some low -cost but secure cryptographic functions in the tag. It would bring a high level of privacy where there is no need for any substantial change in the synopsis of communication between the tag and the reader. On - - the other hand, the tag broadcasts the same data to any reader, with dependency on given authorization, could read and process all or part of the said data. The major challenge faced when trying to provide security for low-cost radio frequency identification (RFID) tags in their very limited resources- for example, tag memory will be restricted to several hundred bits, and approximately 250-4000 logic gates out of the total tag space can be devoted to security- related tasks. So readers should bear in mind that these constrained devices are unable to support on-chip standard cryptographic primitives. During this research with an exploratory purpose some different protocols around authentication and cryptography in low cost RFID would be investigated and compared as the output and result with a qualitative approach. This strategy makes the opportunity to discover similarities and differences among protocols and solutions. So that specialists or executives who are looking for a proper protocol or scheme correspondent to their needs or priorities, could choose one or two among others, in other words when investigating the varied types of attacks against schemes, the administrator or the customer of the technology (technology buyer) could set up a comparison to find the suitable protocol according to his /her criterions or priorities like the value of data that is going to be transmitted by RFID transceivers in the air field or wireless media, or the probable attacks could happen according to situation of located RFID devices. For example, if the administrator or executive knows that the position or location that his/her RFID devices located are vulnerable to DOS attack would not choose RHLK or LCAP as the appropriate protocol, or if he/she assumes that spoofing or replay attack is more probable than other attacks then would not choose Li et al. or SRAC schemes for his/ her RFID transceivers authentication.},

	abstract = {Radio frequency identification (RFID) strap attachment modality is more reliable, low cost, and easy to assemble, and therefore, it becomes increasingly more popular in RFID tag designs. This paper presents a single-ended probe method with power transmission coefficient compensation for the characterization of RFID straps. Approximate identification of the read/write threshold power and impedance is based on the charge status of voltage multipliers and charge pumps instead of on the read/write-modulated commands. For comparison purposes, the conventional source-pull system is also briefly reviewed and applied to verify the measurement results of absorbing power and impedance of RFID straps using the presented method. An enhanced source-pull system, named RFID source-pull system, for an RFID strap that can accurately measure the threshold power and impedance for read/write-modulated commands is also constructed for verifying the presented method. Alien and Texas Instruments (TI) straps are used for measurement examples in this paper. It is found that the measurement results of both RFID straps obtained by the presented method agree well with those by the conventional source-pull system and the RFID source-pull system. The single-ended probe method can measure the approximate read/write threshold power and impedance of the RFID strap with minimum operating procedures; furthermore, the complicated radio frequency (RF) facilities are not required. Obtaining the read/write threshold power and impedance of RFID straps allows designers to estimate the maximum read range of the designed RFID tag in advance. Therefore, the implemented cost and design cycle times can substantially be reduced.},

It is only recently that the technology has begun to take off in the mass market. RFID applications in mobile phone business have not yet been deployed in other that small scale, but the discussion around this topic has been really started. Analysts predict that RFID will revolutionize areas of industry, such as supply chain management and the retail business, for example by reducing costs with better stock management. As the components for RFID-systems - tags and readers - have become smaller and cheaper, the technology has begun to take-off, in a variety of different areas This paper focuses on the applications of RFID technology in mobile telecommunication services.

	abstract = {Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology has been widely used in passive RFID localisation application due to its flexible deployment and low-cost. But current passive RFID localisation systems cannot achieve both highly accurate and precise moving object localisation task owing to tag collisions and variation of the behavior of tags. Most researchers increase the density of tag distribution to improve localisation accuracy, and then consider using either anti-collision process embedded in the hardware of the RFID reader or advanced localisation algorithms to enhance localisation precision. However, advanced anti-collision processes for RFID devices are challenged by the physical constraint characteristics of radio frequency; and improved localisation algorithm cannot fundamentally reduce the impacts of tag collision on localisation precision. This research work attempts to improve localisation precision of a passive RFID localisation system by using sparsely distributed RFID tags. This paper first defines a measure for accuracy and precision in a passive RFID localisation system with regard to RFID Tag Distribution. An exponential based function is then derived from experimental measurements, which reflects the relationship between RFID Tag Distribution and localisation precision. This function shows that localisation precision is mainly determined by tag density of RFID Tag Distribution. Based on the experimental findings, a sparse RFID Tag Distribution approach is proposed. The results show that in comparison with the conventional RFID Tag Distribution; passive RFID localisation system with sparse RFID Tag Distribution can deliver a higher localisation precision for the required accuracy.},

	abstract = {Radio frequency identification (RFID) is an automatic identification technology which identifies physical objects individually according to their unique identifiers (ID) recorded in each RFID tag. Many business processes require the integrity verification of a group of objects in addition to individual object identification. This paper proposes ``group coding'' of RFID tags with which we can verify the integrity of groups of objects by writing parity check data to the memory of RFID tags. It was revealed by simulations and experiments that we could determine the number of missing RFID tags up to 10 with accuracy over 99\% when we write 96 bits of the checksum data to 20 RFID tags. The whole duration of group decoding measured in the experiment was approximately 2 to 3 s. The time to compute group encoding and decoding was in the order of several milliseconds and thus negligible. The RFID inventory accounts for the majority of the duration. Note to Practitioners-Current RFID features fast identification of many physical objects. However, the integrity check of a group of objects is usually done by looking up a packaging list or a shipment list in EDI, which requires a network connection. Our proposed ``group coding'' of RFID tags can perform the group integrity check without a network connection. In addition, when the integrity of the group is infringed, the group coding can determine the number of RFID tags missing from the group. These features of group coding can reduce the cost of looking up shipment lists and locate missing RFID tags. The accuracy of the determination is controlled by adjusting the size of data written in each RFID tag. Adopters of group coding can select the optimal performance of group coding from the requirements of the accuracy and constraints like memory consumption of RFID tags.},

	abstract = {There has been a considerable amount of reduction in transaction costs and decrease in stock shortage with the use of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology in automation. Most of the RFID networks include a wide range of automation technologies. These technologies are RFID readers, RFID writers, RFID barcode scanners, RFID smart sensors and RFID controllers. In this study, a solution has been provided for the problems encountered in parking-lot management systems via RFID technology. RFID readers, RFID labels, computers, barriers and software are used as for the main components of the RFID technology. The software has been handled for the management, controlling, transaction reporting and operation tasks for parking lots located on various parts of the city. Check-ins and check-outs of the parking-lots will be under control with RFID readers, labels and barriers. Personnel costs will be reduced considerably using this technology. It will be possible to see unmanned, secure, automized parking-lots functioning with RFID technology in the future. Check-ins and check-outs will be handled in a fast manner without having to stop the cars so that traffic jam problem will be avoided during these processes. Drivers will not have to stop at the circulation points and parking tickets will be out of usage during check-ins and check-outs. It will be avoided ticket-jamming problems for the ticket processing machines as well. Vehicle owners will not have to make any payments at each check-out thus a faster traffic flow will be possible. Since there won't be any waiting during check-ins and check-outs the formation of emission gas as a result of such waiting will be avoided. An automized income tracking system, a car tracking system for charging and a central parking-car tracking system have been developed and utilized. Instead of cars' parking on streets, a more modern and a fast operating parking-lot system have been developed.},

Guidelines typically request that RFID application providers publish their privacy policies. Although several guidelines outline the primary components of privacy policies, few guideline have addressed how RFID application providers can establish privacy policies. This work proposes a scheme, which is going to be adopted by the RFID Applications for Campus Security and Safety Enhancement Project in Taiwan, to help RFID application providers establish RFID privacy policies in consideration of openness and enforcement. By using the proposed scheme, RFID application providers can clarify privacy practices for their applications in RFID privacy policies and communicate these policies to application users. Moreover, application providers can provide evidence to third parties trusted by both application providers and users to ensure that policies are enforced. While an increasing number of countries have started requesting that RFID application providers publish their privacy policies, this work will help countries develop guidelines and regulations for RFID application providers establishing application-based privacy policies.},

	abstract = {RFID technology is an important tool in modern supply chain management. This paper analytically studies the use of RFID in a two-echelon single-manufacturer single-retailer supply chain with the vendor managed inventory (VMI) scheme. First, the supply chain models under a retail replenishment problem with and without RFID are constructed. Second, both the levels of risk and the expected profits of the supply chains are explored. Third, measures which can coordinate the supply chains with and without RFID are proposed. Fourth, comparisons between the cases with and without RFID are made. This paper analytically illustrates several important managerial insights which include: (i) when the RFID tag cost is very small, employing the RFID technology yields an improved supply chain with both larger expected profit and smaller risk; (ii) there exist multiple return policies which can coordinate the supply chain with RFID and the respective upper and lower bounds are identified; (iii) it is beneficial for the manufacturer to take the initiative to share the retailer's cost of RFID implementation, and this action not only can help coordinate the supply chain but also lower the manufacturer's risk; and (iv) compared to the case without RFID, the return rate under the coordinating return policy for the case with RFID can be lower if the RFID tag cost is appropriately shared between the retailer and the manufacturer. These insights are important for both industrialists and academicians.},

	abstract = {RFID has been adopted by many organizations in recent years. The existing inventory models - commonly used for reordering the products by the retailer - have been well studied for non-RFID implementations. In this paper, we modify these models to consider RFID implementations. The problem we address in this paper is how RFID implementations can affect the production models. RFID implementations incur additional costs, which is a disadvantage for organizations involved in the supply chain. However, the advantage of RFID is that it can make the supply chain continuously visible thus reducing the production lead times to zero or almost negligible. The key question we address is, if RFID technology is implemented, should the organization move to a different production model to reap the benefits of RFID implementations? This paper discusses the conditions under which an RFID implementation is beneficial compared to a non-RFID implementation for existing inventory models. We argue that, in most cases, changes to an organization's inventory model is required for an RFID implementation to be beneficial. We present detailed mathematical expressions and illustrate them with examples to support our claims.},

Considering the huge amount of goods, the successful reading of RFID data becomes a crucial issue. Many algorithms and models to improve the RFID reading have been proposed, yet most of them focus on addressing the problem in a single reading node. In this paper, we introduce a P2P model to identify and remove inaccurate reading of RFID data by utilizing the information exchanged among related nodes along the business processing route of each RFID tagged item. The successful deployment of this model will ease the demand for high accurate reading of each RFID reading node while reducing the total cost of the RFID network. Our simulation shows the RFID network correct function against the business requirements will be ensured while the overall performance of the RFID network can be guaranteed.},

	abstract = {Bicycle riding is one of the most casual sports, and almost everyone owns a bicycle. However the bicycle industries currently have no effective management methods, including production management, theft and sale certification, so that bicycle-related industries are seeking to solve their problems by using RFID. RFID is a non-contact automatic identification technology; mainly it is composed by the identification code embedded in a chip and antenna to receive the data. Because bicycles are made of metal materials or advanced carbon fiber materials, all these materials will affect electromagnetic waves. And also, the bicycle production processes are subject to a lot of high temperature paint treatment. The Tags are also buried in the body for future identification after sale. Currently the bicycle industry prefers putting RFID tags under not easily noticed place. The only place is under the seat location packaged with RFID where LF combined with the special antenna and tag reader is used to successfully read and solve the problem of bicycle production and certification. However, the problem how to solve theft? RFID tags built with a memory can be entered with personal information, bicycle information, and so. The current RFID technology indeed can be applied in this context, and even the whole plate was proposed to be used with RFID to carry out the vehicles supervision, traffic management, anti-theft applications. However the privacy creates the greatest resistance because people do not want their whereabouts being traced. Integrated with GPS and GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), RFID is used for personal management. The problem of insufficient power supply will be solved by integrating with solar panels. Finally, the very light weight characteristics of UHF will be applied to the competition of human sports. RFID operation principles are: 1) Reader emits radio frequency signal when the RFID tag gets into the read range. 2) The energy obtained by induced- - current is used to send identification code, or reader takes the initiative to send the signal. 3) After reader reads the message, the message is decodes and then sent to application system to process for query, track, or statistical purposes. RFID applications cover in a wide range, most of which are vehicle access control, logistics management, container management, transportation fee system, automatic control and stored value cards. By using RFID characteristics such accessing a large data capacity, high portability, confidentiality and etc.. This paper implements a bicycle management system for anti-theft, certification, and competition to assist bicycle industry production and after-sales service. The RFID system integrated with image capture technology is used by the relevant industry for athletic competition to replace the manual record, and manage their time and personal safety for sports programs. UHF tags with almost no weight placed on athlete body during competition are integrated with cameras, GPS systems, and the 3G network to obtain the real-time game data. It can be applied to the competitions such as bicycling, walking and climbing to ensure real-time monitoring and the safety of athletes.},

In general, research related to RFID's potential contributions fall under technological, applications-related, or policy and security issues. However, there's little discussion in the extant literature on the environmentally responsible management of RFID. Traditionally, information and communications technologies (ICT) have been viewed as having a negative impact on the environment, and RFID, as part of ICT, has earned a similar reputation. RFID is also one of the main technologies of pervasive computing, which consumes enough energy to negatively impact the environment. Furthermore, some experience has suggested that we need to take precautionary measures to prevent the likely negative results from the final disposal of RFID labels. Currently, RFID tags are neither biodegradable nor recyclable. Nonetheless, RFID could indeed be a part of green IT, not only by adding economic value to organizations but also by improving environmentally responsible practices related to IT-for example, by accurately tracking a perishable item and preventing its spoilage, RFID can save energy in operations ranging from growing and harvesting to packaging and refrigeration. To explore RFID's potential in green IT, we reviewed 13 case studies, evaluating RFID's contribution to green objectives.},

In this paper, we present a modular and cost-effective navigation technique incorporating signals from RFID tags, an RFID reader, and a fuzzy logic controller (FLC). The RFID tags are placed at 3-dimensional positions in the robot's workspace in such a way that the lines linking their projection points on the ground define "free-ways" along which the robot is desired to navigate. The RFID reader is mounted on the mobile robot to communicate with the RFID tags to determine the robot's position. The FLC is then applied to guide the robot along a pre-defined trajectory in an unknown working environment. For this purpose, we introduce two minor changes to the RFID tag architecture while keeping that of the RFID reader unchanged. A simplistic circuit and a primitive microcontroller are added to the RFID tag to compute the signal's power received by the tag and encode it within the tag ID, respectively. This way, virtually any commercially available RFID reader can be used without the need for any special customization. The performance of the proposed navigation scheme is evaluated through several numerical simulations.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a sequential image stitching approach for creating high-quality panoramic images on mobile devices. In this approach, each source image in the image sequence is stitched onto the panoramic image sequentially using two operations: optimal seam finding and transition smoothing. In the seam finding process, graph cut optimization finds an optimal seam and creates labeling in the overlapping area between the current panoramic image and the current source image. The current panoramic image can be updated by merging the current source image using the labeling information. If there are visible stitching artifacts in the seam, a transition smoothing operation is performed to hide the seam and remove the stitching artifacts. In the transition smoothing process, a gradient vector field is created from the gradients of corresponding pixels in the current labeled source image to construct a Poisson equation. A composite image can be recovered from the gradient vector field by solving the Poisson equation with boundary conditions. The current panoramic image is updated by merging the composite image. The approach presents several advantages. The use of graph cut optimization guarantees finding optimal seams and avoids blurring and ghosting problems caused by objects moving between capture of input images or by spatial alignment errors.

Since the images are captured on this moving platform, the sudden vibration may cause the images blurred. These unclear frames must be removed for improving the quality of the mosaic image. Also, when stitching the images in the indoor environment, the distance between the scene and camera is closer than that in the outdoor air reconnaissance mission. The motion parallax easily exists in the continuously captured image sequence. The hierarchical image stitching method with the dominant image selection for a same scene is proposed to reduce the motion parallax region in the mosaic image. The experimental results validate the proposed image stitching algorithm producing a mosaic image with better image quality than that of the other method.},

	abstract = {Clear image stitching becomes mature now, but how to stitch blurred images with clear ones is still tough, mainly because of the ill-posed image deblurring. Existing deblurring methods assume spatial-invarint blur kernel, pixelwise constant blur kernel or planar camera motion. But these assumptions are difficult to hold in the real blurred image which is a spatial-variant blurred image by 3D camera motion. To overcome such limits for stitching blurred image, in this paper, we present a new feature based framework of stitching a clear/blurred image pair. It is inspired by recently proposed projetive warping models depicting the camera movement embedded in the capturing process of the blurred image. Our main contribution is a feature based algorithm for kernel estimation using the overlapped clear/blurred image pair. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed stitching method.},

In this framework, the images taken by neighboring sensors are stitched together with an image stitching technique to remove the overlap redundancy. The image stitching process will be carried out in certain intermediate nodes along the way towards a centralized decoder. This will help to conserve more power since the amount of data to be transmitted is reduced. In addition, the tree structure adapted by SPIHT is modified to improve the flexibility in coding the stitched image.

	abstract = {Camber is one of the most important defects in the endless hot-rolling process, and can be defined as the longitudinal curvature of a slab or strip in the plan view. To obtain a value of the camber for a steel bar, the overall shape of a slab or strip is required. However, the strip is too long to capture overall image at once. In order to obtain precise information on the overall shape of the bar, two area-scan charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras to obtain partial bar images and the image stitching algorithm are needed. This paper proposes a fast algorithm to obtain the overall shape of a steel bar in the endless hot rolling process. The proposed algorithm reduces the computational complexity and the running time of the image stitching process by adaptively selecting the search region to find feature points in steel bar images. The algorithm consists of three parts: generating the feature points and descriptors of the selected regions of continuous images for the steel bar, choosing the overlapped region between the present image and the next image, and stitching the partial bar images after calibrating them. The proposed stitching algorithm based on adaptive selection of the search region improves the performance of the camber measurement system during the image stitching process.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new algorithm for Image Registration and Stitching. The algorithm is designed to be extremely efficient and fast in its execution and is intended for use in stitching images extracted from a video stream of a camera. This algorithm is not universally applicable to all the image registration and stitching problems. It is customized to be used to generate single images of surfaces such as a conveyor belt or undercarriage of vehicles, which cannot be captured by a single photo. The algorithm works by extracting edges of the two images to be registered. Then it selects a reference section from the first image and search in the second image where it finds the best match for that section. The best match is the east difference score. The section in the second image which gives the least difference score is then identified as the registration point between the two images. The speed of the algorithm is improved by using heuristics to restrict the search space in the second image. We present full details of how the extraction of the heuristic is done from the inputs and how it drastically reduces the execution time of the algorithm. The paper also contains a full section on comparing our algorithm with a set of existing algorithms. Our algorithm outperforms the existing ones for all the common image sizes.},

Our new approach is based on structure deformation and propagation for achieving the overall consistency in image structure and intensity. The new stitching algorithm, which has found applications in image compositing, image blending, and intensity correction, consists of the following main processes. Depending on the compatibility and distinctiveness of the 2D features detected in the image plane, single or double optimal partitions are computed subject to the constraints of intensity coherence and structure continuity. Afterwards, specific 1D features are detected along the computed optimal partitions from which a set of sparse deformation vectors is derived to encode 1D feature matching between the partitions. These sparse deformation cues are robustly propagated into the input images by solving the associated minimization problem in gradient domain, thus providing a uniform framework for the simultaneous alignment of image structure and intensity. We present results in general image compositing and blending in order to show the effectiveness of our method in producing seamless stitching results from complex input images.},

	abstract = {Image stitching techniques are widely used to integrate multi-view or sequential images into one image. But visible seams, blurring, or ghosting effects may occur in the overlapping regions for real image stitching. One approach to solve this problem is to find some kinds of seams in regions where the images agree, and then a weighted or blended integrating can be carried out around the pixels on the seams, which makes the transitions from one image to the other not visible. The traditional dynamic programming based method is proved to be effective to find such optimal seam but has an obvious drawback that its searching direction is restricted, so that it is not suitable to find an optimal seam connecting two specified points which is often required for sequential image stitching. Facing the above problem, a new optimal seam definition based on minimum cost is given, and then an optimal seam selection method based on enhanced dynamic programming is proposed in this paper. The analysis and visual results of our experiments using some real airborne sequential images show that, the approach proposed in this paper can handle significant structure misalignment and eliminates structure seam for the global seamless image stitching.},

In this paper, we present a new mathematical criterion to select an optimal warping function among a set of possible candidates (e.g., parametric family). The proposed criterion can be considered as a direct view condition for image stitching , i.e., it is desirable that each part of the composite image looks like its corresponding input image. More specifically, we do not use an explicit modeling of a compositing surface, but, we focus on the differential properties of a warping function. That is we design a cost function so that the Jacobian matrix of a warping function is close to a shape preserving matrix such as rotation and reflection matrices. The proposed cost function can be effectively minimized by using Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.

This paper proposes a approach to stitch images fast and with high quality.Image alignment algorithms can discover the correspondence relationships among images with varying degrees of overlap. In this process, they uses SIFT to look for the trait points, and uses RANSAC to delete the wrong points. Image stitching algorithms take the alignment estimates produced by such registration algorithms and blend the images in a seamless manner by a kind searching method, which can deal with potential problems such as blurring or ghosting caused by parallax and scene movement as well as varying image exposures. Several real alignment images stitching experiments are carried out. The experimental results show that the algorithm can improve stitching visual quality obviously with acceptable computing cost.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an algorithm for eliminating the blurred image regions during image stitching. Since the camera is close to the objects when capturing the images in the indoor environments, stitching the images in the indoor scenes easily generates the blurred ghosting region. Here the reasons of blurred region generations can be categorized into two kinds. First, the slight camera vibration may result in the whole images unclear over a short span of frames. These unclear frames can be filtered out by distinguishing the clearness of the edge images between different scales. The other reason for originating the blurred region is that several image frames contain the same scene from different views. There may exist the inconsistent structures and observations in these different views. The color blending is performed to let the seam between aligned images smooth, however, it also makes these inconsistent region blurred, which is called the ghosting effect. Here, an optimal seam selection algorithm is proposed by utilizing the A* search algorithm to find a segment path away from the inconsistent overlap region and then remove the ghosting effect. The experimental results validate that the proposed algorithm can obtain the mosaic image with good quality and clear resolution.},

	abstract = {Various applications such as mosaicing and object insertion require stitching of image parts. The stitching quality is measured visually by the similarity of the stitched image to each of the input images, and by the visibility of the seam between the stitched images. In order to define and get the best possible stitching, we introduce several formal cost functions for the evaluation of the stitching quality. In these cost functions the similarity to the input images and the visibility of the seam are defined in the gradient domain, minimizing the disturbing edges along the seam. A good image stitching will optimize these cost functions, overcoming both photometric inconsistencies and geometric misalignments between the stitched images. We study the cost functions and compare their performance for different scenarios both theoretically and practically. Our approach is demonstrated in various applications including generation of panoramic images, object blending and removal of compression artifacts. Comparisons with existing methods show the benefits of optimizing the measures in the gradient domain.},

year={1999},
pages={506-515},
abstract={In order to enhance the performance of a 3D laser scanning system, a low occlusion approach is analyzed to find the best view for scanning by considering the object position instead of the sensor position. Based on a 2-axis 3D color scanner developed by OES/ITRI, the best position (BP) of an object on the rotary table will be focused to meet the best view requirements for the low cost scanner. Since the 2-axis 3D scanner only consists of linear and rotary moving apparatuses, in general, it needs 2 or more scanning processes to capture multiple layers to register and merge to a complete 3D file. In order to optimize the scanned layers and minimize the amount of data, we propose an algorithm to effectively decrease the amount of scanned layers and to acquire best-view data in the 2-axis 3D scanner based on the proposed best-position criteria. In the experimental results, the emphasized problems of the worst case really occur when the object is set at an infeasible position. And the best-view scanning is illustrated after the object is reallocated suitably with the best position by the proposed algorithm. Hence, besides the NBV problem, the low-occlusion criteria proposed in the paper also play an important role for acquiring complete 3D data. In future, we will focus on the development of the automatic procedure to combine the NBV solution to achieve more efficient scanning for any complex 3D model},

abstract={We describe a method for 3D object scanning by aligning depth scans that were taken from around an object with a Time-of-Flight (ToF) camera. These ToF cameras can measure depth scans at video rate. Due to comparably simple technology, they bear potential for economical production in big volumes. Our easy-to-use, cost-effective scanning solution, which is based on such a sensor, could make 3D scanning technology more accessible to everyday users. The algorithmic challenge we face is that the sensor's level of random noise is substantial and there is a nontrivial systematic bias. In this paper, we show the surprising result that 3D scans of reasonable quality can also be obtained with a sensor of such low data quality. Established filtering and scan alignment techniques from the literature fail to achieve this goal. In contrast, our algorithm is based on a new combination of a 3D superresolution method with a probabilistic scan alignment approach that explicitly takes into account the sensor's noise characteristics.},

We employ this system to explore the suitability of the standard 3D scanning pipeline when working with stereo range data of objects and architecture in an outdoor setting. Our range scanning system is very mobile without any mechanical actuators. We rely solely on the inertial navigation system for coarse registration with out any cumbersome manual procedure or scene dependent visual feature tracking. Our detail registration is a variant of the Iterative Closest Point algorithm. We introduce a set of heuristics that aims to produce reliable and repeatable convergence despite the diversity of the objects, and types of motions that may be executed by the operator during the scanning process. We also show that in an outdoor setting, range data based on classical binocular stereo can be effective for 3D modeling. Our system produces results of only slightly lower quality than an indoor triangulation scanner at a much lower system cost.},

abstract={The 3D scanning of human faces is an important tool to acquire accurate shape and texture information of heads and faces for both animation and recognition purposes. One of the most popular scanning tools is Cyberware head and face 3D colour scanner. Currently, 3D face databases scanned using the Cyberware head and face 3D colour scanner databases are publicly available and have been used in many face recognition system as the training data, one of which is USF human ID 3-D database. The mechanism of facial texture capturing, however, remains unclear due to the special settings of the light sources during scanning. The direct application of the acquired texture intensity as the albedo of the face surfaces leads to suboptimal modelling results. This paper analyses the lighting configuration of the scanner and proposes an appropriate reflectance model to describe the reflecting mechanism when scanning. The texture modifications can be carried on in the existing scanning results without any further scans. Experiment results show that the proposed reflectance model can better approximate the reflecting situation of scanning so that the acquired textures can be directly used as diffuse reflectance coefficients and achieve better rendering results. Key words: 3D face model, 3D scanner, facial textures, lighting condition, reflection model.},

In sight of the increasing capability of 3D scanning systems to produce models with millions of points, compression efficiency is of paramount importance. In this paper, we propose a novel competition-based predictive method for single-rate compression of 3D models represented as point cloud. In particular we aim at 3D scanning methods based on grid pattern. The proposed method takes advantage of the pattern characteristic made of vertical and horizontal lines, by assuming that the object surface is sampled in curve of points. We then designed and implemented a predictive coder driven by this curve-based point representation. Novel prediction techniques are specifically designed for a curve-based cloud of points, and been competing between them to achieve high quality 3D reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract={Translucent objects pose a difficult problem for traditional structured light 3D scanning techniques. Subsurface scattering corrupts the range estimation in two ways: by drastically reducing the signal-to-noise ratio and by shifting the intensity peak beneath the surface to a point which does not coincide with the point of incidence. In this paper we analyze and compare two descattering methods in order to obtain reliable 3D coordinates for translucent objects. By using polarization-difference imaging, subsurface scattering can be filtered out because multiple scattering randomizes the polarization direction of light while the surface reflectance partially keeps the polarization direction of the illumination. The descattered reflectance can be used for reliable 3D reconstruction using traditional optical 3D scanning techniques, such as structured light. Phase-shifting is another effective descattering technique if the frequency of the projected pattern is sufficiently high. We demonstrate the performance of these two techniques and the combination of them on scanning real-world translucent objects.},

A set of mechanical equipment driven by a step motor is designed to rotate the scanning plane of a 2D laser range finder to realize 3D scanning. A micro-controller system is embedded for the scanning control and synchronization with the host computer. Measurement data are acquired by a self-developed high-speed data transmission board. Besides the inherent measurement error of the 2D laser range finder, the error of the resulting 3D LADAR system is mainly caused by two reasons: 1) the unknown offset between the axis of the pitching motion and the actual origin of the 2D laser range finder; 2) the initial attitude error. Based on the system measurement model, a least sum of squared error method is adopted to calibrate the system. The experimental results show that the resulting system has high scanning speed, high data accuracy and therefore is a cost effective means to acquire high quality 3D data},

The measurement processes contain the steps as follows: 1) scan the semifinished blade by using the robotic 3D scanning system, and then acquire the scanning model of the semifinished blade (SM_SFB); 2) register the SM_SFB and the designed model of the finished blade (DM_FB) to position the two model's locate surfaces (LS) coincide; 3) get the removed-material (RM) for every point on DM_FB by calculating the distance between the point and the intersection of the SM_SFB and the DM_FB's normal through this point.},

year={2011},
pages={455-462},
abstract={The complexity of natural scenes and the amount of information acquired by terrestrial laser scanners turn the registration among scans into a complex problem. This problem becomes even more challenging when two individual scans captured at significantly changed viewpoints (wide baseline). Since laser-scanning instruments nowadays are often equipped with an additional image sensor, it stands to reason making use of the image content to improve the registration process of 3D scanning data. In this paper, we present a novel improvement to the existing feature techniques to enable automatic alignment between two widely separated 3D scans. The key idea consists of extracting dominant planar structures from 3D point clouds and then utilizing the recovered 3D geometry to improve the performance of 2D image feature extraction and matching. The resulting features are very discriminative and robust to perspective distortions and viewpoint changes due to exploiting the underlying 3D structure. Using this novel viewpoint invariant feature, the corresponding 3D points are automatically linked in terms of wide baseline image matching. Initial experiments with real data demonstrate the potential of the proposed method for the challenging wide baseline 3D scanning data alignment tasks.},

abstract={Designing a low cost structured light system which can acquire 3D data in real time with great accuracy is still an ongoing topic among computer vision community as it is hard to achieve all these features together. Among various structured light systems, pseudorandom array is the most suitable technique for real time 3D reconstruction as it tends to concentrate the entire coding scheme in a single pattern. But it has the difficulty of decoding the pattern when it loses few pattern symbols. In this paper, we address this problem by introducing an error correcting 3D scanning technique. This technique consists of a two way decoding method which can decode a dual pseudorandom array and a hole-filling algorithm. In the experimental results, we show that our 3D scanning technique largely improves the reconstruction compared to the conventional methods.},

abstract={This paper proposes a method of retrieving texture from images containing pattern used for one shot 3D scanning system based on a grid pattern. Range scanners using projector-camera systems can be used for real-time 3D scanning with accurate results and at a low cost. However, these techniques cannot retrieve color information from the captured object since to obtain the best results, they require dark environments and the projection on the object to reconstruct dense and bright lines pattern masks most of the object textures. Therefore, we propose a technique of slightly modifying the input of a given 3D scanning system in order to have bright images with texture information and then retrieve the textures of the object using an in painting method. The presented method adapts simple algorithms such as Canny filter and patches based in painting in order to obtain a fully automatic method that does not require any user intervention.},

abstract={Image recognition in image understanding is very challenge research topic. However, the study of recognition and enhancement of the specific target for the computer generated image is very less. Compared with the natural image, this cause may be the characteristics (simple in overall) and the scene of applications (the 3D roaming, the game and so on) for the computer-generated image. For recognition and enhancement of the specific target (such as traffic sign) in the computer-generated image, the difficulty is how to accurately recognize and enhance the specific target, and maintaining other information of object do not been changed. In this paper, adopting stepwise refinement method attempts to solve the problem. The proposed method is based on three steps including image preprocessing, image recognition and enhancement. The experimental results show the method can be very good to deal with such issues. The research result shows that the image recognition and image enhancement is still not simple process. Therefore, we imagine that image recognition for complex real scene image also isn't simple issues.

abstract={There are several techniques for image recognition. Among those methods, application of soft computing models on digital image has been considered to be an approach for a better result. The main objective of the present work is to provide a new approach for image recognition using Artificial Neural Networks. Initially an original gray scale intensity image has been taken for transformation. The Input image has been added with Salt and Peeper noise. Adaptive median Filter has been applied on noisy image such that the noise can be removed and the output image would be considered as filtered Image. The estimated Error and average error of the values stored in filtered image matrix have been calculated with reference to the values stored in original data matrix for the purpose of checking of proper noise removal. Now each pixel data has been converted into binary number (8 bit) from decimal values. A set of four pixels has been taken together to form a new binary number with 32 bits and it has been converted into a decimal. This process continues to produce new data matrix with new different set of values. This data matrix has been taken as original data matrix and saved in data bank. Now for recognition, a new test image has been taken and the same steps as salt & pepper noise insertion, removal of noise using adaptive median filter as mentioned earlier have been applied to get a new test matrix. Now the average error of the second image with respect to original image has been calculated based on the both generated matrices. If the average error is more than 45% then a conclusion can be made that the images are different and cannot be matched. But if the value of average error has been found to be less than or equal to 45%, an effort has been made to use the artificial neural network on test data matrix with reference to original data matrix thereby producing a new matrix of the second image(test image). The total average error has been calculated on generated da- a matrix produced after the application of artificial neural networks on test data matrix to check whether proper identification can be made or not. It has been observed that the value of average error is less than that of test image without application of artificial neural network. Further it has been observed that the test image is matching and recognized with respect to original image.},

abstract={This paper describes a two-stage recognition method that reduces the calculation load of correlation and improves recognition accuracy in statistical image recognition. It consists of an image screening and recognition stage. Image screening selects a candidate set of subimages that are similar to the object class using a lower dimensional feature vector. Since recognition is made for the selected subimages set using a higher dimensional feature vector, overall recognition efficiency is improved. The classifier in recognition designed from the selected subimages also improves recognition accuracy because selected subimages are less contaminated than the original ones. A screening criterion for measuring overall efficiency and accuracy of recognition is introduced to be exploited in designing the feature spaces of image screening and recognition. The results of experiments for the eye- and mouth-area detection in face images and text-area detection in document images show that the designed feature spaces improve recognition accuracy and more efficiency than does the conventional one-stage recognition method},

abstract={In this paper, we formulate the problems of image copy detection and image recognition in terms of sparse representation. To achieve robustness, security, and efficient storage of image features, we propose to extract compact local feature descriptors via constructing the basis of the SIFT-based feature vectors extracted from the secure SIFT domain of an image. Image copy detection can be efficiently accomplished based on the sparse representations and reconstruction errors of the features extracted from an image possibly manipulated by signal processing or geometric attacks. For image recognition, we show that the features of a query image can be represented as sparse linear combinations of the features extracted from the training images belonging to the same cluster. Hence, image recognition can also be cast as a sparse representation problem. Then, we formulate our sparse representation problem as an l1-minimization problem. Promising results regarding image copy detection and recognition have been verified, respectively, through the simulations conducted on several content-preserving attacks defined in the Stirmark benchmark and Caltech-101 dataset.},

year={2009},
pages={398-403},
abstract={Recognition of burning states is a critical issue in sintering process control of rotary kiln, and the recognition is usually based on the temperatures of burning zone. Recently, flame image-based burning states recognition has received much attention. However, most of the methods reported involve image segmentation, which is a very challenging problem due to the poor quality of flame images of rotary kiln, and the recognition accuracy is hard to guarantee. In this study, we propose a new method for burning states recognition without demanding image segmentation. The basic idea of this new method is to extract features from eigen-flame images to classify these flame images using probabilistic neural network. The advantages of the new method are threefold. Firstly, the new method is computationally more efficient than image segmentation-based methods. Once the eigen-flame images are obtained off-line, feature extraction is simply a process of correlating an image with each of the eigen-flame images. Secondly, the eigen-flame image-based features capture the global characteristics of an image and hence can lead to more accurate recognition. Thirdly, the new method is robust and is able to deal with images with poor quality. The proposed new method is validated through extensive experimental studies, to show that the new method improves recognition accuracy substantially compared with image segmentation-based methods and temperature-based methods. It is expected that more consistent product quality, higher yield and lower energy consumption can be achieved if the new burning state recognizer is incorporated into our previously developed hybrid control system for rotary kiln.},

abstract={This paper introduces a new concept for the establishment of human-machine symbiotic relationship through interactive image recognition. The system is based on the implementation of knowledge-based image processing methodologies for intelligent recognition of image and intelligent responding for an autonomous robot or machine. This paper includes two novel contributions of image application; one is image metamorphosis another is image recognition for intelligent system. Using these two important image applications we have achieved the interactive image recognition for human-machine interfacing. The system is organized with the learning and recognition of images using neural network with back-propagation algorithm. Images have been processed and converted to feature vectors that are compared with the feature vectors of a training set of images. This image recognition system can play a big role over establishing more perfect human-machine interfacing. The proposed system has been tested extensively with a large data set and it performs accuracy of 93.33% on that database.},

year={2000},
pages={463-467},
abstract={In a digital image network for traffic monitoring a large number of cameras are connected to control centers through a hierarchical network. Compressed image data and recognition results are transmitted over the network. With conventional approaches, each control center receives compressed image data along with preliminary recognition results from low level control centers or surveillance cameras. Each center needs to decompress image data for further recognition processing, and if necessary the center sends the compressed image data and recognition results to the upper-level control center. In order to increase the cost-efficiency of the digital image network, we propose eliminating the decompression required at each center by developing a recognition method which works in the compressed domain. The main stream of conventional image compression methods such as discrete cosine transform is based on spatial frequency which makes it difficult to carry out recognition processes in the compressed domain. In contrast, we will compress the image data by using attributes which are relevant both for compression and recognition. Examples of the common attributes are binary edge locations and the color information surrounding the edge. This and other information is retained in the compression domain to enable recognition without decompression},

title={An alternative method for designing parallel image recognition systems: a feasibility study},
year={1995},
pages={286-292},
abstract={The most successful image recognition systems have been developed in software. This method has proved to be quite laborious and the execution time is intensive. An alternative method of designing image recognition systems is needed. The goal is to design a reliable, compact, high speed, low cost recognition system. One way to reach this goal is to design the image recognition system via a massively parallel hardware architecture. The present study researches the feasibility of developing a generalized procedure to design unique image recognition systems. These unique image recognition systems will incorporate special purpose processors that will work at a speed that is several orders of magnitude faster than software image processing systems. These systems have great application perspectives, especially in the robotics and industrial fields. One of the most important aspects of these systems-is the unique compact size as compared with other systems of comparable speed. Also, these systems are independent modules that will output, in most cases, a signal to a controller without the need to use a conventional computer or processor. The procedure to be developed provides a new way of designing an image processing system by concentrating on modularity and massive parallelism. Combining the modules will provide a special purpose processing system that achieves object detection and recognition at a high speed not even possible on a general purpose supercomputer.

year={2012},
pages={222-223},
abstract={The use of image recognition technologies is becoming more popular recently in a variety of industries such as automotive, surveillance, and others. SoCs for such image recognition applications are required to be powerful enough to support real-time multiple object recognition, with power consumption not exceeding a few Watts. Adaptability to a range of applications is also desirable. In this context, massively parallel processors and heterogeneous many-core processors with 200GOPS have been proposed. However, rising demands for simultaneous execution of multiple applications leads to even higher performance requirements. In advanced driver-assistance systems for automotive, for example, forward collision warning and traffic sign recognition should execute simultaneously to improve safety of the system. In addition, the accuracy of recognition is also important. With its high accuracy (96% detection rate/0.1% false-positive rate), object recognition using co-occurrence histograms of oriented gradients (CoHOG) is a promising algorithm. However, the algorithm requires an extensive amount of computation. For example, a desktop computer with a 3GHz quad-core processor is needed for CoHOG-based pedestrian detection in a backover prevention (BOP) application. Considering these requirements, we have developed an image recognition SoC with the following features: 1) a multi-core processor to provide adaptability to various applications; 2) accelerators for image processing tasks and image recognition tasks to realize high performance at low power consumption; and, 3) a hardware accelerator for a CoHOG based real-time recognition.},

abstract={To achieve automatic diagnosis of plant diseases and improve the image recognition accuracy of plant diseases, two kinds of grape diseases (grape downy mildew and grape powdery mildew) and two kinds of wheat diseases (wheat stripe rust and wheat leaf rust) were selected as research objects, and the image recognition of the diseases was conducted based on image processing and pattern recognition. After image preprocessing including image compression, image cropping and image denoising, K_means clusteri and then 21 color features, 4 shape features and 25 texture features were extracted from the images. Backpropagation (BP) networks were used as the classifiers to identify grape diseases and wheat diseases, respectively. The results showed that identification of the diseases could be effectively achieved using BP networks. While the dimensions of the feature data were not reduced by using principal component analysis (PCA), the optimal recognition results for grape diseases were obtained as the fitting accuracy and the prediction accuracy were both 100%, and that for wheat diseases were obtained as the fitting accuracy and the prediction accuracy were both 100%. While the dimensions of the feature data were reduced by using PCA, the optimal recognition result for grape diseases was obtained as the fitting accuracy was 100% and the prediction accuracy was 97.14%, and that for wheat diseases was obtained as the fitting accuracy and the prediction accuracy were both 100%.},

abstract={The goal of the paper is to present a novel approach for designing massively parallel architectures for image recognition systems. Massive parallel hardware produces high speed image recognition. Hardware architectures work much faster and are more effective for application specific processing than a software-based image recognition system. The concept of designing optimal image recognition systems with high speed, low complexity, good portability, and lowhnique presented provides a new method of designing an image recognition system by concentrating on modularity and massive parallelism. This is accomplished through the design of a processing element layer, local communicator layer, and network of new image layer. The processing element (PE) layer performs the basic recognition functions on individual pixels through logical operations. Both the local communicator and network of new image layers institute a mesh network topology, which has proven to be the fastest and most efficient. The local communicator layer has the most important function, it communicates with the other two layers, combines results from the PE layer, and houses the main control unit. All layers work simultaneously, or in other words, in a parallel fashion. The flow diagram of a CAD designer algorithm, based on this new design technique, is presented},

title={Close the loop: Joint blind image restoration and recognition with sparse representation prior},
year={2011},
pages={770-777},
abstract={Most previous visual recognition systems simply assume ideal inputs without real-world degradations, such as low resolution, motion blur and out-of-focus blur. In presence of such unknown degradations, the conventional approach first resorts to blind image restoration and then feeds the restored image into a classifier. Treating restoration and recognition separately, such a straightforward approach, however, suffers greatly from the defective output of the ill-posed blind image restoration. In this paper, we present a joint blind image restoration and recognition method based on the sparse representation prior to handle the challenging problem of face recognition from low-quality images, where the degradation model is realistic and totally unknown. The sparse representation prior states that the degraded input image, if correctly restored, will have a good sparse representation in terms of the training set, which indicates the identity of the test image. The proposed algorithm achieves simultaneous restoration and recognition by iteratively solving the blind image restoration in pursuit of the sparest representation for recognition. Based on such a sparse representation prior, we demonstrate that the image restoration task and the recognition task can benefit greatly from each other. Extensive experiments on face datasets under various degradations are carried out and the results of our joint model shows significant improvements over conventional methods of treating the two tasks independently.},

abstract={In wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs), low cost complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) camera sensors may only produce low resolution images due to hardware limitations. However, super-resolution images may be constructed from these low resolution images in a multiple sensor network, improving object pattern recognition success rates. There is a critical image recognition challenge in these reconstructed super-resolution images for accuracy, complexity and limited energy resource in wireless sensor networks. Artificial immune systems (AIS), in particular those possessing algorithmic efficiency for image pattern differentiation, categorization and recognition, have potential advantages in low-cost automated monitoring and object detection applications. In this paper, we study the application of AIS for distributed and collaborative image pattern recognition in wireless multimedia sensor networks possessing energy efficient image communications and in-situ image content processing. Our contributions are two fold. First, we propose an innovative approach involving dimension reduction to accelerate the AIS algorithm within an environment of low cost computing and efficient data transmission among the wireless sensor nodes. Second, a sleep control algorithm is proposed to reduce the image redundancies in order to achieve energy efficiency while guaranteeing the object recognition success rate in dynamic WMSN topology. Simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed approaches gain significant performance improvements in energy efficiency and in-network image content processing for WMSN. The algorithmic and simulation works are validated with the field data in collaborations between the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Raytheon Company.},

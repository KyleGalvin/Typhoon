<tex2html_mydb_mark>#3#%Telepresence has been used in many forms in academia university for more than a decade by now as entities that help to maintain the relationship with learners and provide them with collaborative experiences without the expense of physical travel. However, the emerging technology has shifted its focus from the large class-room telepresence equipmentâ€™s to be scaled- down to mobile, wireless-networked telepresence products. With this technology shift, we are required to provide the learner with the ubiquitous ability to explore core learning contents deployed over the internet as well as to enable learners to interact with many other remote physical learning environments (e.g., Web environments, instructors, colleagues) through the use of mobile devices. This project aims at exploring this research area and to come with a solution for implementing a new type of learning objects that can be used over the air for telecollaboration and telepresence suitable for mobile platforms. 

<tex2html_mydb_mark>#4#%Our goal is to bring virtual telepresence farther along this continuum until it is as close to actual presence as possible

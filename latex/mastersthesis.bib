Although there exist well developed single modalities for communication, we do not really understand the general problem of designing integrated multimodal systems. Recent advances in mobile communication based on picocellular technologies allow the transmission of high bandwidth data over personal surrounding networks. We analyse the sources of real time constraints in telepresence and augmented reality applications. We offer an approach to adding aspects of mobility and augmented reality to real time mobile telepresence, discuss the technology and potential future product concept vision, the CyPhone, and depict the general architecture and integration framework briefly.

	abstract = {This paper reports an electroencephalogram-based brain-actuated telepresence system to provide a user with presence in remote environments through a mobile robot, with access to the Internet. This system relies on a P300-based brain-computer interface (BCI) and a mobile robot with autonomous navigation and camera orientation capabilities. The shared-control strategy is built by the BCI decoding of task-related orders (selection of visible target destinations or exploration areas), which can be autonomously executed by the robot. The system was evaluated using five healthy participants in two consecutive steps: 1) screening and training of participants and 2) preestablished navigation and visual exploration telepresence tasks. On the basis of the results, the following evaluation studies are reported: 1) technical evaluation of the device and its main functionalities and 2) the users' behavior study. The overall result was that all participants were able to complete the designed tasks, reporting no failures, which shows the robustness of the system and its feasibility to solve tasks in real settings where joint navigation and visual exploration were needed. Furthermore, the participants showed great adaptation to the telepresence system.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the control concept of a semi-mobile haptic interface for extended range telepresence that enables the user to explore spatially unrestricted target environments even from a small user environment. The semi-mobile haptic interface consists of a haptic manipulator mounted on a large grounded Cartesian robot, the prepositioning unit. The prepositioning unit is controlled in such a way that the haptic manipulator is kept off its workspace limits. At the same time, the control algorithm allows the optimal utilization of the available space in the user environment and guarantees the safety of the user. The proposed control method is based on the position and velocity of the end-effector and also takes the position of the user into account. Moreover, it is robust against noisy measurements of the user position or outliers due, for example, to occlusions in the tracking system. Experimental results show the suitability of the proposed control to provide haptic interaction in extended range telepresence.},

The user's sense of presence is also enhanced through the capability to manipulate objects remotely via the robot gripper. The display system is a television display system that can be worn like a pair of glasses. The head movements of the user are monitored using color tracking, and the displayed images are updated accordingly. This is achieved by interpreting the human head movements and transforming them into control signals for the robot and its mounted color camera. Novel features of the presented system include: utilization of human implicit commands, availability and cost-effectiveness of the system, feeling of presence, and intelligence fusion of the human user with robot's intelligence. The new version of the telepresence system that is currently under development is also presented},

The spectrum of required assistive functionalities and services that have been specified by the different end-user target groups of such a robot companion (the elderly, relatives, caregivers) is manifold. It reaches from situation-specific, intelligent reminding (e.g. taking medication or drinking) and cognitive stimulation, via mobile videophony with relatives or caregivers, up to the autonomous detection of dangerous situations, like falls, and their evaluation by authorized persons via mobile telepresence. From the beginning, our approach has been focused on long-term and everyday suitability and low-cost producibility as important prerequisites for the marketability of the robot companion. Against this background, the paper presents the main system requirements derived from user studies, the consequences for the hardware design and functionality of the robot companion, its system architecture, a key technology for HRI in home environments - the autonomous user tracking and searching, up to the results of already conducted and ongoing functionality tests and upcoming user studies.},

	abstract = {We describe a method for dynamically variable region-of-interest editing of MPEG-2 video streams in the compressed domain to reduce bandwidth. This method is used in our second-generation mutually immersive mobile telepresence system, where only the region containing a user's head in an acquired video stream needs to be displayed at the remote location. This editing is performed in a way that leaves the resulting stream consistent with the MPEG-2 standard. We currently reduce the transmission of data by skipping macroblocks or deleting DCT coefficients outside the region of interest in P and B pictures, and deleting DCT coefficients in I frames. This results in a savings of approximately 50\% of the bandwidth of the original stream for our application. Since we are transmitting four video streams to the surrogate over our wireless network, the total bandwidth is reduced by about 5 Mbit/s. As an added benefit, the CPU requirements for decoding the edited stream in software are also reduced by approximately 16\%.},

	abstract = {The authors' institute has established that precise surgical procedures can be carried out with Telepresence. Within this decade, Telepresence surgery may become an established component of a new, technologically enhanced mode of cost-effective health care delivery. Because of the substantial medical and financial benefit that Telepresence will bring to laparoscopic and other minimally invasive procedures, its first routine use is expected to be within the individual hospital and surgical center. Telepresence surgical procedures have been demonstrated over distances of 160 meters, and the authors are working toward demonstrating animal surgeries over a much greater distance by using microwave and fiber-optic links. Mobile Telepresence surgical equipment may prove especially effective for trauma care in combat and in civilian disasters. Because the stereographic images and the motions and forces can be readily scaled, microsurgeries of all kinds can be made easier with this technology. Arthroscopic procedures, especially difficult surgery on joints such as the wrist and shoulder, are good Telepresence candidates. In neurosurgery, excision of pituitary adenomas could benefit from the increased dexterity and tactile sensitivity of Telepresence. Eventually, neurosurgery under real-time magnetic resonance imaging could be performed by a Telepresence surgeon operating on a three dimensional reconstruction that is immediately updated to show the actual tissue changes caused by the telemanipulated instruments},

A mobile teleoperator in the remote environment replicates this motion. The user can thus control the mobile teleoperator's locomotion by walking. A stereo-camera system mounted on the mobile teleoperator constantly records live camera images and transfers them to the user environment, where they are presented to the user on a head-mounted display. This paper presents a long distance experiment, in which a mobile teleoperator was controlled over a standard Internet connection by natural locomotion. Without further processing of the user's motion data, however, only exploration of a remote environment of the same size or smaller than the user environment is possible. As this is not desirable, we use motion compression, an optimal nonlinear transformation of the user's path. This algorithm allows controlling free motion in an arbitrarily large target environment from a limited user environment.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the construction of a novel belt tactile interface and telepresence system intended for mobile robot control. The robotic system consists of a mobile robot and a wearable master robot. The elaborated algorithms allow the robot to precisely recognize the shape, boundaries, movement direction, speed, and distance to the obstacle by means of the laser range finders. The designed tactile belt interface receives the detected information and maps it through the vibrotactile patterns. We designed the patterns in such a way that they convey the obstacle parameters in a very intuitive, robust, and unobtrusive manner. The robot movement direction and speed are governed by the tilt of the user's torso. The sensors embedded into the belt interface measure the user orientation and gestures precisely. Such an interface lets to deeply engage the user into the teleoperation process and to deliver them the tactile perception of the remote environment at the same time. The key point is that the user gets the opportunity to use own arms, hands, fingers for operation of the robotic manipulators and another devices installed on the mobile robot platform. The experimental results of user study revealed the effectiveness of the designed vibration patterns for obstacle parameter presentation. The accuracy in 100\% for detection of the moving object by participants was achieved. We believe that the developed robotic system has significant potential in facilitating the navigation of mobile robot while providing a high degree of immersion into remote space.},

In particular, teleoperated mobile robots need to have some kind of backup system when the operator is blind to the remote situation owing to failure of the vision system. In Hong S-G et al. (see Mechatronics), the idea of artificial force reflection was proposed to enhance the reliability of operation when the mobile robot travels over plain ground. We extend these results to help the teleoperator even when the robot climbs stairs. The extended artificial force reflection method has two modes: traveling on plain ground and climbing stairs. When traveling over plain ground, the force information is artificially generated using range data from the environment while generating the impulse force when climbing stairs. To verify the validity of our algorithm, we develop a simulator which consists of a joystick and visual display system.

The mobile robot embodies a remote human to have communications with other human while walking in close proximity to the mobile robot. The robot takes the role of a physical interface to deploy mobility, sensors and telepresence with personification throughout some behaviours of the remote human. Behaviours are conveyed through commands from a mouse/joystick and a EEG-based BRI. We discuss the aim of this work, as well as the tele-system architecture. Both the mobile robot featuring avatar capabilities, and the BRI are discussed. The system concept is also described and we report implementations and experimental results.},

By integrating the robotic perception of a remote environment and transferring it to a human user through haptic environmental feedback, the disabled user can increase one's capability to interact with remote environments through the telepresence robot. This paper presents a framework that integrates visual perception from heterogeneous vision sensors and enables real-time interactive haptic representation of the real world through a mobile manipulation robotic system. Specifically, a set of multi-disciplinary algorithms such as stereovision processes, three-dimensional map building algorithms, and virtual-proxy haptic rendering processes are integrated into a unified framework to accomplish the goal of real-world haptic exploration successfully. Results of our framework in an indoor environment are displayed, and its performances are analyzed. Quantitative results are provided along with qualitative results through a set of human subject testing. Our future work includes real-time haptic fusion of multi-modal environmental perception and more extensive human subject testing in a prolonged experimental design.},

Driving a mobile device by using human brain signals might improve the quality of life of people suffering from severely physical disabilities. By means of a bidirectional audio/video connection to a robot, the BCI user is able to interact actively with relatives and friends located in different rooms. However, the control of robots through an uncertain channel as a BCI may be complicated and exhaustive. Shared control can facilitate the operation of brain-controlled telepresence robots, as demonstrated by the experimental results reported here. In fact, it allows all subjects to complete a rather complex task, driving the robot in a natural environment along a path with several targets and obstacles, in shorter times and with less number of mental commands.},

TELEROBOT is a teleoperated mobile robotic platform equipped with videoconferencingcapabilities and designed to be used in a home environment to. In this study, learnability of the system's teleoperation interface and controls was evaluated with ten rehabilitation professionals during four training sessions in a laboratory environment and in an unknown home environment while performing the execution of a standardized evaluation protocol typically used in home care. Results show that the novice teleoperators' performances on two of the four metrics used (number of command and total time) improved significantly across training sessions (ANOVAS, p<;0.05) and that performance in these metrics in the last training session reflected teleoperation abilities seen in the unknown home environment during navigation tasks (r=0,77 and 0,60). With only 4 hours of training, rehabilitation professionals were able learn to teleoperate successfully TELEROBOT. However teleoperation performances remained significantly less efficient then those of an expert. Under the home task condition (navigating the home environment from one point to the other as fast as possible) this translated to completion time between 350 seconds (best performance) and 850 seconds (worse performance). Improvements in other usability aspects of the system will be needed to meet the requirements of in-home telerehabilitation.},

The techniques employed allow children to rapidly gain access to a large repository of multimedia information through the use of a camera- equipped mobile phone. Especially, there are many usages of external marks (EM) on the off-line contents. To tackle this problem, a few researches use content-based image retrieval (CBIR) based on object colors to recognize real images with a simple computation. However, this has problems of low recognition rates and slows processing on mobile devices with low-resolution camera. There are three issues should be considered in this research field: (1) low recognition rates, (2) fast processing, and (3) rotation-size invariant. To solve drawbacks that use of the EM and difficulty of the color-based image retrieval (CoBIR) by means of a low-resolution camera-equipped mobile phone, we used for shape-based image retrieval (SBIR) system. The ALC can provide learners with quick and accurate on-line contents on off-line using mobile devices without limitations of space. Our aim was to establish whether or not this user interaction technique could be harnessed for education based applications targeted at young children.},

Almost all (97.4\%) of the participants who would pay for mLearning courses believed that mLearning would enhance their present learning capabilities. MLearning will assuredly be accepted in the future, since 96.6 per cent of university students stated they wanted to use mLearning if they can access the material with no charge. The proposed mLearning sciences and technology program can be structured into three main areas: wireless technology, mobile education and application management.},

Most of the mobile laboratory programs that are now in operation focus on providing middle and high school students and teachers with access to science equipment and supplies that are difficult for them to acquire and maintain. In addition, many of the mobile laboratory programs provide inquiry-based curricular materials that are engaging, substantive, and thought provoking. Further, since mobile laboratories are completely self-sustained and can travel to urban and rural locations that are often educationally and economically disadvantaged, they provide equal access to state-of the art learning opportunities. The use of mobile laboratories is an innovative way to transform science teaching and learning, particularly in the pre-college setting. While many of the mobile laboratory programs now in operation focus on the biological sciences, we believe that these programs can be adapted to broader applications in STEM education. Mobile laboratories have the potential to offer powerful and unique ways to engage and inspire future scientists and engineers. These ``vehicles'' may pique the curiosity of students and motivate them to continue their study of science in high school and beyond. As such, mobile science laboratories may contribute to increasing the number of students who become science-literate citizens and members of the science workforce.},

The paper presents the problem and makes a research on combining mobile learning with eLML. ELML, which is released by University of Zurich (Switzerland), is a kind of e-Lesson markup language based on XML framework. It is independent on any special learning platforms and abides by SCORM standard. Additionally, eLML has features of being powerful transplantable capability and easily integrates with mainstream e-learning platforms. Therefore, it recommends applying eLML to the mobile learning application field. However, there are two problems, which have prevented eLML from using at mobile learning platforms. (1) Not all mobile devices can read eLML contents directly; (2) eLML cannot recognize mobile devices automatically and cannot optimize e-Lesson contents in accordance with capabilities of mobile devices. To solve them, the paper proposes to make use of multi-serving technologies to recognize mobile devices and then generate mobile learning materials according to devices' capabilities. On the above of studies, the paper introduces an approach on how to design and implement a mobile learning system architecture based on eLML framework.

However, most of current learning resources (LR) were designed with desktop computers and high-speed network connections. Moreover, for different user preferences in mobile learning environment, not all of the data are relevant and critical to the learning process. It is a challenge to deliver such learning resources to various devices with limited capability over low-speed wireless network while ensuring higher synthetically quality of learning resource. To solve above problem, in this paper we proposed a Learning Resource Adaptation and Delivery Framework to adapt learning resources to various learning environments. It consists of two layers: multimedia adaptation layer and learning object adaptation layer. In the multimedia adaptation layer, MPEG-21 Digital Item Adaptation (DIA) mechanism is incorporated to handle the adaptation of low-level multimedia contents contained in learning resources. In the learning object layer, the appropriate selection of learning objects is based on an extended Learning Object Model for mobile learning. With the introduction of an integrated quality mechanism filling the quality metrics gap between high-level learning objects and low-level multimedia objects, an adaptation decision algorithm is presented to ensure higher final adaptation quality of learning resources},

Technology progress in the field of learning has evolved especially with the use of e-learning and now with the emergence of a new concept called m-learning due to mobile technologies, which are probably the most influential technology for teaching and learning in the next decade. Internet access remains inaccessible to most of our students. But almost all students have access to mobile technology. Nevertheless, the m-learning has some constraints in the use of mobile technologies such as the size of the screen which is too small for reading, battery life that is in constant progress but still low for e-learning applications, user interfaces that are not user-friendly on most mobile phones and diversity of mobile devices and the rapidly changing trends suggest producing ``LMS mobiles'' adaptable to a wide range of mobiles. To avoid redundancy in the reproduction of content that exists in the e-learning environment, we combined in this approach the use of mobile device in the blended learning to offer to our students the opportunity to be mobile and use the mobile as the medium of information. In this paper the benefits of mobile-learning and its use in the INTTIC's Moodle platform are presented. A new way to send information to different learners is developed, relying on the multimedia podcasting technology. This latter is still relatively new and not widely known.},

M-learning not only provides educational oppurtunities through handheld devices, but also facilitates just in time information required at the right time and right place. Though m-learning provides mobility and instant access to education, there are some implementation challenges and issues like limited processing capability and small screen display that needs researchers attention. Keeping in view the latest trends in Information, Electronics and Communication Technologies(IECT) and the increased usage of mobile phones in India, this paper discusses mobile learning technologies, opportunities and challenges for success-full implementation of m-learning. It is observed that most of the students in India use low cost mobile phones that too with different hardware capabilities and features. Researchers and developers in education domain should consider these mobile capabilities and challenges before developing m-learning video content. Pilot experiment was conducted to study different mobile video presentation styles, file formats and their playback capabilities using students mobile phones. Students from various finishing schools were involved in carrying out this experiment. Based on pilot results, instructional design strategy and mobile video content development guidelines were formulated catering to the requirements of student community in India.},

	abstract = {Mobile learning, the learning method which learners can leverage mobile devices to learn everywhere, has become the one of the most potential learning approach as novel mobile devices emerges. However, how the novel mobile learning technology can be accepted by learners was seldom addressed. Meanwhile, due to the unavailability of large number (more than 100) experts for evaluating novel mobile learning devices, the traditional statistical methods, e.g. the structural equation model (SEM), are not appropriate for evaluating the factors influencing the acceptance of novel techniques, a feasible research framework will be very helpful for achieving the evaluation purposes. In this work, the author proposes a novel technology acceptance modeling (TAM) evaluation framework with the fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) based Network Process (DNP) to resolve the above mentioned real world problem. The SEM based analytic results based on learners will be introduced for demonstrating the effectiveness of the Fuzzy DNP. An empirical study based on the analysis of factors influencing Taiwanese mobile learners' acceptances of some specific mobile learning software being installed in iPhone will be introduced for demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. Based on the analytic results, the Fuzzy DNP based framework can be used for real world technology acceptance analysis of novel mobile learning techniques. Meanwhile, the derived factors which can influence the mobile learning technology acceptances can serve as the basis for educators and marketers for designing and improving the next generation learning devices.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the importance of providing adaptive learning services has noticeably increased in web-based learning environments. Context-aware learning is an excellent solution to customizing learning, since by taking learners' context information into consideration, learning could be offered in a personalized manner, and as a result, the efficiency of the learning process will increase. Moreover, with mobile and handheld devices being widely used nowadays, mobile learning could be viewed as another option for customization of learning. In this paper, a learning model is introduced, based on which context-aware mobile learning capability is added to a learning management system (LMS). With this goal, learner's context information (i.e. his mood and his desired view of the system) is demanded from him, according to which he is provided with a learning environment appropriately structured for his context. The proposed model was tested on a group of learners to assess the performance of the added component from a user point of view. Comparing the personalized LMS with the original one, the results demonstrated a significant enhancement of learners' satisfaction and the quality of learning. Using the presented approach, learning will be a less time-consuming and more efficient process, leading to a more extensive use of learning management systems.},

The proposed BWL system was designed using a wireless mobile ad-hoc learning environment. In our designed system, each individual learner has a wireless handheld device, which is a PDA (personal digital assistant) with an IEEE 802.11 wireless network card and a small-sized CCD camera. One instructor has a notebook computer with a wi-fi wireless LAN card which serves as the local server. The notebook has a complete butterfly database. All learners' wireless handheld devices and the notebook constitute a mobile ad-hoc learning environment. During the butterfly-watching activity, each learner takes a distinct butterfly picture, and wirelessly transmits the picture to the local server. A content-based butterfly-image retrieval technique is applied to search for the most closely matching butterfly information, which is returned in real time to the learner's wireless handheld device. To illustrate the effect of the BWL system, an outdoor BWL activity was actually performed at elementary school in Taiwan. This article reports on our attempts to develop a new m-learning system to support an independent learning model. We deeply believe that it is worth developing a mobile learning system to provide a possible independent-learning environment for outdoor learners.},

	abstract = {Video surveillance has been widely used in recent years to enhance public safety and privacy protection. A video surveillance system that deals with content analysis and activity monitoring needs efficient transmission and storage of the surveillance video data. Video compression techniques can be used to achieve this goal by reducing the size of the video with no or small quality loss. State-of-the-art video compression methods such as H.264/AVC often lead to high computational complexity at the encoder, which is generally implemented in a video camera in a surveillance system. This can significantly increase the cost of a surveillance system, especially when a mass deployment of end cameras is needed. In this paper, we discuss the specific considerations for surveillance video compression. We present a surveillance video compression system with low-complexity encoder based on Wyner-Ziv coding principles to address the tradeoff between computational complexity and coding efficiency. In addition, we propose a backward-channel aware Wyner-Ziv (BCAWZ) video coding approach to improve the coding efficiency while maintaining low complexity at the encoder. The experimental results show that for surveillance video contents, BCAWZ can achieve significantly higher coding efficiency than H.264/AVC intra coding as well as existing Wyner-Ziv video coding methods and is close to H.264/AVC inter coding, while maintaining similar coding complexity with intra coding. This shows that the low motion characteristics of many surveillance video contents and the low-complexity encoding requirement make our scheme a particularly suitable candidate for surveillance video compression. We further propose an error resilience scheme for BCAWZ to address the concern of reliable transmission in the backward-channel, which is essential to the quality of video data for real-time and reliable object detection and event analysis.},

	abstract = {Wireless video sensor networks are anticipated to be deployed to monitor remote geographical areas. To save energy in bit transmissions/receptions over a video sensor network, the captured video content needs to be encoded before its transmission to the base station. However, video encoding is an inherently complex operation that can cause a major energy drain at battery-constrained sensors. Thus a systematic evaluation of different video encoding options is required to allow a designer to choose the most energy-efficient compression technique for a given video sensing application scenario. In this paper, we empirically evaluate the energy efficiencies of predictive and distributed video coding paradigms for deployment on real-life sensor motes. For predictive video coding, our results show that despite its higher compression efficiency, inter video coding always depletes much more energy than intra coding. Therefore, we propose to use image compression based intra coding to improve energy efficiency in the predictive video coding paradigm. For distributed video coding, our results show that the Wyner-Ziv encoder has consistently better energy efficiency than the PRISM encoder. We propose minor modifications to PRISM and Wyner-Ziv encoders which significantly reduce the energy consumption of these encoders. For all the video encoding configurations evaluated in this paper, our results reveal the counter-intuitive and important finding that the major source of energy drain in WSNs is local computations performed for video compression and not video transmission.},

	abstract = {Video monitoring is often conducted in hospitals. In case of prolonged monitoring, huge amounts of data are generated. There is a high demand for very efficient video compression methods. The current medical video systems utilize standard compression algorithms such as MPEG-1 and MPEG-2, which were designed for generic video rather than medical video. The features of this type of video such as long idle periods and small local motions, are not sufficiently addressed in these standards. As a result, current systems produce considerable redundancy in the output data. In this paper, we present a two-step method to compress medical monitoring video more efficiently. In the first step, a novel algorithm is utilized to detect the motion activities of the input video sequence. Then, the video sequence is segmented into several rectangle image regions (video object planes), which contain motion activities restricted within these windows. In the second step, the generated video object planes are compressed by an MPEG-4 module (or any module that features high compression efficiency). Our experimental results show that the two-step method improves the compression ratio significantly when compared with the existing generic MPEG algorithms while still retaining the essential video quality.},

Compared to H.264/AVC and H.26L-FGS video coding, the advantage of Witsenhausen-Wyner video coding and layered Wyner-Ziv video coding is error robustness when the compressed video has to be delivered over a noisy channel. The price for this added error robustness is a small loss of compression performance. In multiterminal video coding for video sensor network applications, since the encoders are not allowed to communicate with each other, the use of distributed source coding is out of necessity. We propose a generic scheme for multiterminal video coding based on Slepian-Wolf coded quantization, where we explore multiple view geometry in computer vision to generate the side information. Experimental results with two- and three-view video sequences show that our multiterminal video coder can achieve a lower sum-rate than separate H.264/AVC coding. Comparison with the standard JMVM joint encoding scheme is also provided.},

For this purpose, we studied and implemented two well known video compression and decompression algorithms i.e. Run Length Encoding (RLE) and Arithmetic Coding (AC). The main advantage of these compression techniques is that it almost compresses and decompresses all types of video files. In this work, we computed the compression rate on different video files by applying both algorithms.

This technique supports all three MPEG-4 functionalities tested in the November 1995 tests, namely, improved coding efficiency, error resilience, and content scalability.

Patch-based super-resolution finds similar patches between an up scaled non-key frame and the associated, high-resolution key frame to regain lost detail via a super-resolution process.

In this model, the temporal ordering and the spatial viewpoints of the video streams being viewed are completely determined at authoring time. In contrast, we have defined a form of interactive video called active video (see http://www.ecsl.cs.sunysb.edu/∼anindya/avs/avs.html, 2002), which supports hyper-linking among related video sequences and interpolation of video sequences with neighboring viewpoints, to offer end users the additional flexibility of choosing the sequencing and the viewing angle (even virtual ones) at playback time. However, active video has a substantially higher storage and transmission cost due to multiple time-synchronized video streams capturing the dynamic scene and the pixel-level correspondence maps encoding the spatial association among the frame-pairs of all adjacent streams. The maps are interpolated at run-time to generate virtual views. We describe and evaluate the following three compression techniques that alleviate the storage and network transmission costs of active video: spatial video compression; lossy map compression; lossless map compression.},

	abstract = {Advanced broadcast manipulation of TV sequences and enhanced user interfaces for TV systems have resulted in an increased amount of pre- and post-editing of video sequences, where graphical information is inserted. However, in the current broadcasting chain, there are no provisions for enabling an efficient transmission/storage of these mixed video and graphics signals and, at this emerging stage of DTV systems, introducing new standards is not desired. Nevertheless, in the professional video communication chain between content provider and broadcaster and locally, in the DTV receiver, proprietary video-graphics compression schemes can be used to enable more efficient transmission/storage of mixed video and graphics signals. For example, in the DTV receiver case this will lead to a significant memory-cost reduction. To preserve a high overall image quality, the video and graphics data require independent coding systems, matched with their specific visual and statistical properties. We introduce various efficient algorithms that support both the lossless (contour, runlength and arithmetic coding) and the lossy (block predictive coding) compression of graphics data. If the graphics data are a-priori mixed with video and the graphics position is unknown at compression time, an accurate detection mechanism is applied to distinguish the two signals, such that independent coding algorithms can be employed for each data-type. In the DTV memory-reduction scenario, an overall bit-rate control completes the system, ensuring a fixed compression factor of 2-3 per frame without sacrificing the quality of the graphics},

	abstract = {Video compression is an essential task in video storage and transmission. In this paper, we worked for compressing the video sequence using Self-organizing map (SOM) and then stored the output feature vector of SOM using Hopfield Neural Network. The SOM algorithm is based on unsupervised, competitive learning. It extracts the useful features from video frames by feature extraction method. In our approach, the video sequence is first divided into video frames. The frames are processed by passing to the input of Self-organizing map (SOM) that outputs the informative features by removing some of the redundant information contained in video frames. Self-organizing map is an efficient method for reducing the size of images in the neural network field. The feature vector obtained is further used for storing the patterns using Hopfield network. The feature vector is applied to the input of the Hopfield neural network and stored in the network for encoding the video frames. Thus the compressed video frames are encoded and stored in memory as a codeword. The codeword is used for reconstruction of the video frames by using the same Hopfield network. The codeword is applied to the Self-organizing map network and the video frames are reconstructed from those codeword. Simulation results show that high compression rate is achieved while maintaining the good reconstruction quality of images.},

Because of the requirements in storing the video data over a period of time for future use and because of the huge size of the raw video data, video compression technique has been integrated into the video camera of the surveillance system. As a state-of-the-art video compression technique, H.264/AVC is generally in use. However, it often leads to high computational complexity, which induces high power dissipation when a tremendous amount of cameras are installed to build a large scale of surveillance system. In this paper, a difference detection algorithm is proposed to work as a preprocessing module before video encoder to reduce the computational complexity of video compression. Because of the independency between the proposed processing and the video encoding scheme, it has high adaptability to work with any existing H.264 video encoder to save the cost in implementation and application. Experimental results demonstrate that an average of over 82\% of computational complexity reduction can be achieved by integrating the proposed algorithm either into an encoder with high complexity rate distortion optimization (RDO) coding scheme or an encoder with fast algorithm. Besides the significant reduction in computational complexity, an average of 0.06 dB improvement in PSNR is further achieved against the H.264 Main Profile with high complexity RDO coding scheme.},

	abstract = {Summary form only given. Distributed source coding has emerged as an enabling technology for sensor networks. It refers to the compression of correlated signals captured by different sensors which do not communicate between themselves. Distributed source coding finds its foundation in the seminal work of Slepian-Wolf (1973) and Wyner-Ziv (1976). The proof of the Slepian-Wolf W theorem is based on random binning, which is non-constructive, i.e., it does not reveal how practical code design should be done. In 1974, Wyner suggested the use of parity check codes to approach the corner points of the Slepian-Wolf rate region. It is only recently that practical solutions based on channel capacity-achieving codes (block codes, turbo codes or LDPC codes) have been explored for applications ranging from video compression, resilient video transmission, to minimization of transmit energy in sensor networks. Video compression, as well as scalable video compression, can be recast into a distributed source coding framework leading to distributed video coding schemes targeting mainly low coding complexity and error resilience functionalities. Correlated samples (pixels or transform coefficients) from different frames are regarded as outputs of different sensors. However, the application of the Wyner-Ziv principles to video compression is not straightforward and requires solving a number of issues. This article presents the underlying theory, the latest developments of distributed video compression and some of the research trends in the area.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel video compression technique tailored to achieve high compression ratio for synthetic and thermal video sequences while maintaining a low level of complexity. The technique relies on the segmentation of each frame into a number of regions. The contours of these regions are subsequently compressed using the entropy encoding. The high compression ratio achieved by this technique can be traded for higher temporal sampling rates to allow the representation of high mobility objects. Three types of video sequences are used to evaluate the proposed technique. These are synthetic, thermal, and real video sequences. Compression Ratio (CR) as well as Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) averaged over all frames are calculated for each type and compared to standard video compression techniques. Although the actual CR achieved is dependent on the number and size of the regions within the frame, the frame size, as well as its color representation; our results show significant improvement in CR up to twenty times the CR achieved using standard techniques. Meanwhile, the reduction in PSNR is limited. Although the relative performance of the proposed technique compared to the standard MPEG-I and MPEG-4, is maintained for all types of video sequences; the observed reconstructed video quality for synthetic and thermal videos is superior to the quality of real videos.},

	abstract = {Wireless sensor networking research has been mainly focused on internal wireless sensor network issues such as MAC and routing protocols, energy saving, HW design and to some extent on the architecture of gateways that connect a wireless sensor network with the rest of the world. Wireless sensor networks have been seen as dedicated to one task by one owner. On the other hand, our research is focused on integration of wireless sensor networks into existing networks, primarily mobile ones, and provision of sensor based and/or enhanced services to remote users. Therefore, we have been working on designing an architecture that utilizes the existing infrastructure to interconnect independent wireless sensor networks and to provide data aggregation and actuator control services. In the proposed architecture, sensor networks (small or large, deployed for any purpose and by anyone) represented by their gateways are treated as leaf nodes hanging off a mobile or fixed network that use these networks to interact with remote and local users. Each gateway exposes the capabilities of its sensors, actuators and the sensor network as a whole. This information is used by sensor services middleware to query/command sensor ecosystems on behalf of applications and remote users interested in sensor measurements or actuator control. The details of the interaction between the gateways and its sensors/actuators are of no interest to the remote users. Further, we consider the whole wireless sensor networking landscape as an open market where the underlying mobile and fixed networks facilitate the interaction between the sensor networks and the consumers of the information they produce. Each sensor network is first of all a sensor information provider that offers specific sensor information defined by the type of available sensors and their spatial and temporal conditions to the interested users. Secondly, each sensor network provides actuation services that may potentially affect the inform- ation gathered by its sensors. Obviously, in such an environment, where many mobile users are acting as tiny information providers, service discovery, service composition, service provisioning and service authorization are very challenging problems. These problems are addressed in the proposed architecture by introducing a middle layer that aggregates information from all small information providers and provides higher level services to the end users. This layer provides the means to quickly add or remove sensors, actuators, sensor networks, sensor network providers, to modify and enhance the existing or add completely new services utilizing the underlying infrastructure. It could be thought of as a "plug-and-play" functionality for: (a) interconnecting different existing sensor networks; (b) adding new sensor networks which facilitate the expansion of the entire system; and (c) expanding the capability of individual sensor networks.},

	abstract = {Multiple sensor nodes deployed in a common neighborhood to sense an event and subsequently transmit sensed information to a remote processing unit or base station, has been the recent focus of research. Tiny sensor nodes, which consist of sensing, data processing, and communicating components, leverage the idea of sensor networks based on collaborative effort of a large number of nodes. These numerous sensors are used (similar to different sensory organs in human beings) for delivering crucial information in real-time from environments and processes, where data collection is impossible previously with wired sensors [1]. Typically, wireless sensor networks are composed of low power sensor nodes and integrate general-purpose computing with heterogeneous sensing and wireless communication. Their emergence has enabled observation of the physical world at an unprecedented level of granularity. One of the most important components of a sensor node is the power unit and may be supported in most applications by a power scavenging unit such as solar cells. Hence, there is a major limitation in a wireless sensor networks, such as, the sensor nodes must consume extremely low power. Also, wireless networks are subject to various kinds of attacks and wireless communication links can be eavesdropped on without noticeable effort and communication protocols on all layers are vulnerable to specific attacks. In contrast to wire-line networks, known attacks like masquerading, man-in-the-middle, and replaying of messages can easily be carried out. Hence, a fundamental issue in the design of wireless sensor networks is the reliability i.e. how long can the wireless sensor networks survive and how well are the wireless sensor networks recovery after the malicious attacks. In this context, in this thesis, the power, mobility, and task management planes that can monitor the power, movement, and task distribution among the sensor nodes are proposed. These planes help the sensor nodes coordi- nate the sensing task and also lower the overall power consumption. In addition, a secure topology discovery algorithm is proposed and its performance is studied for different types of node distributions. The proposed work is the development of architecture for secure communication in mobile wireless networks. The approach divides the network into clusters and implements a decentralized certification authority. Decentralization is achieved using threshold cryptography and a network secret that is distributed over a number of nodes. While this basic idea has been proposed earlier partially, its application on a clustered network is a novelty.},

	abstract = {Existing work on placing additional relay nodes in wireless sensor networks to improve network connectivity typically assumes homogeneous wireless sensor nodes with an identical transmission radius. In contrast, this paper addresses the problem of deploying relay nodes to provide fault tolerance with higher network connectivity in heterogeneous wireless sensor networks, where sensor nodes possess different transmission radii. Depending on the level of desired fault tolerance, such problems can be categorized as: 1) full fault-tolerant relay node placement, which aims to deploy a minimum number of relay nodes to establish k(k ? 1) vertexdisjoint paths between every pair of sensor and/or relay nodes and 2) partial fault-tolerant relay node placement, which aims to deploy a minimum number of relay nodes to establish k(k ? 1) vertex-disjoint paths only between every pair of sensor nodes. Due to the different transmission radii of sensor nodes, these problems are further complicated by the existence of two different kinds of communication paths in heterogeneous wireless sensor networks, namely, two-way paths, along which wireless communications exist in both directions; and one-way paths, along which wireless communications exist in only one direction. Assuming that sensor nodes have different transmission radii, while relay nodes use the same transmission radius, this paper comprehensively analyzes the range of problems introduced by the different levels of fault tolerance (full or partial) coupled with the different types of path (one-way or two-way). Since each of these problems is NP-hard, we develop O(?k2)-approximation algorithms for both one-way and two-way partial fault-tolerant relay node placement, as well as O(?k3)-approximation algorithms for both one-way and two-way full fault-tolerant relay node placement (? is the best performance ratio of existing approximation algorithms for finding a minimum k-vertex connected spanning graph). To f- - acilitate the applications in higher dimensions, we also extend these algorithms and derive their performance ratios in d-dimensional heterogeneous wireless sensor networks (d ? 3). Finally, heuristic implementations of these algorithms are evaluated via QualNet simulations.},

	abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are the collection of self - organizing sensor nodes deployed in various physical environments statically or dynamically depends upon the application. In wireless environment these sensor nodes are defenseless or vulnerable against attacks. To solve this problem the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has been used and for wireless networks, Distributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDS) has been used. But this is not sufficient to achieve maximum resiliency against attacks. Considering the issues here a new Dynamic Intrusion Detection Protocol model (DYDOG) has been designed based on data flow for High Error Rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Here the Dynamic Intrusion Detection nodes are deployed based on the proposed protocol model which will acts as forwarding node as well as Intrusion Monitoring Node with respect to the data flow through the sensor nodes. The Dynamic Intrusion Detection Nodes are selected from the one-hop or two hop neighbor's non-forwarding node list by using Secure Session Key Management approach without deploying separate Intrusion Monitoring Nodes. This makes the network is more flexible and dynamic against various attacks and provide maximum monitoring node's availability with better resiliency in high error rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The monitoring nodes are dynamically changed in its behavior within the session itself depends on mobility and based on proposed conditions. For an attacker it will create problem to identify and attack the Dynamic Intrusion Detection Nodes within the limited session. By this protocol the attacks and compromised nodes can be effectively identified at runtime in high data rate static or dynamic Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Now the research is going on On-Line Updates for local agents and global agents individually in high data rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), when the network has maximum mobility and maximum data rate.},

Specially, the jobs sending and processing sensing data information from on sensor node to the others are more majority parts than merely sensing some events. Thus, energy-efficient routing protocol in wireless sensor networks is necessary for increasing the network lifetime and is also influenced by many challenging factors in terms of energy, processing, and storage capacities. In this paper, we designed and implemented a reliable energy aware routing (REAR) protocol for wireless sensor networks and evaluated the performance of REAR by comparing with existing routing protocols. REAR considers residual energy capacity of each sensor node in establishing routing paths and supports multi-path routing protocol for reliable data transmission. Furthermore, REAR allows each sensor node to confirm success of data transmission to other sensor nodes by supporting the DATA-ACK oriented packet transmission. Finally, the performance evaluation results show that REAR provides energy-efficiency and reliability related to wireless communication in wireless sensor networks.},

Within clustering, the optimization of cluster head (CH) location is critical since CHs consume energy faster and have greater influence on lifetime than non cluster head (NCH) sensors. Energy harvesting wireless sensor networks (EH-WSNs) use energy harvesting devices to harvest energy from environment. In contrast with the traditional battery powered wireless sensor networks, EH-WSNs have extended network lifetime substantially. In this paper, we present a single cluster algorithm for lifetime optimization in homogeneous wireless sensor networks with one solar powered sensor. The proposed method could determine the optimal CH location within a given network distribution. We include the solar powered sensor node as relay node for CH and determine the optimal position for it. We evaluate the performance of our method through theoretical analysis as well as simulation. We found through the use of our method, the overall network lifetime could be optimized.},

Like IEEE 802.3 wired and IEEE 802.11 wireless networks, remote wireless sensor networks are vulnerable to malicious attacks. While wired and infrastructure-based wireless networks have mature intrusion detection systems and sophisticated firewalls to block these attacks, wireless sensor networks have only primitive defenses. WSNs rely on hardware simplicity to make sensor field deployments both affordable and long-lasting without any maintenance support. Energy-constrained sensor networks periodically place nodes to sleep in order to extend the network lifetime. Denying sleep effectively attacks each sensor node's critical energy resources and rapidly drains the network's lifetime. This paper analyzes the energy resource vulnerabilities of wireless sensor networks, models the network lifetimes of leading WSN medium access control (MAC) protocols, and proposes a new MAC protocol which mitigates many of the effects of denial of sleep attacks.},

	abstract = {A sensor network is applied to various fields from the special application fields such as wild environment monitoring, industrial machine measurement, and military-purpose measurement to the daily application fields such as fire monitoring and pollution monitoring. A Wireless Sensor Network is a wire and wireless network, which consists of several sensor nodes deployed in a certain field. A sensor node should have computation, sensing and wireless communication functions. A sensor network has a limited computing and communication resource. To overcome this barrier, collaboration with surrounding nodes is required. In other words, information sharing between hierarchies is required rather than a hierarchical approach. A sensor network generally consists of a large number of sensor nodes for exact sensing and extendibility of the sensing areas. Therefore, attackers can easily capture sensor nodes. And an attacker is able to attack the sensor node itself and the sensor network through a modified attack on sensor nodes. Therefore, the security of a sensor network is important. The attestation for sensor nodes suggested by this paper consists of 2 steps. STEP 1. Inter-connective attestation between surrounding sensor nodes STEP 2. If there is any abnormality, the node notifies the BS (Base Station) and requests attestation as to whether there is a damaged node or not. Initial sensor node attestation is carried out by inter-connective sensor nodes, not by the BS. If there is any abnormality, the node notifies the BS. And BS carries out attestation for node showing abnormality. Attestation for the BS and sensor node uses an authentication protocol method for preventing nodes from being captured. As mentioned above, because there is a periodic simple attestation procedure between sensor nodes and sensor node attestation, it is easy and rapid to identify which is captured by attacker; thus, a secure sensor network is attainable.},

	abstract = {In wireless sensor networks, owing to the limitation of energy, memory, and computation, it is necessary to construct the networks under the constraints. To save the energy, the censoring sensor that transmits information of its observations only when it is informative was proposed, and the optimal censoring region was derived so that the detection probability was maximized. The on-off sensor that is either awake or asleep (on or off) is also effective to save the observation energy. The collaboration of censoring and sleeping plays a great role in saving more energy. In this paper, we derive the mutual information in a wireless sensor network with i) censoring sensors, ii) on-off sensors, and iii) censoring and on-off sensors. Under the constraint on the average cost of each sensor, we also derive the optimum censoring and sleeping probabilities with respect to the mutual information in the sensor networks. Using the mutual information, we show that the largest mutual information in the sensor network with censoring and on-off sensors can always be achieved. We also show that the mutual information in the sensor networks with on-off sensors and with censoring and on-off sensors are larger than that in the sensor network with censoring sensors when the average cost of each sensor is small and the observation cost is large. Furthermore, we show that the largest mutual information in the sensor networks with censoring and on-off sensors and with censoring sensors can be obtained when the average cost of each sensor is not small and the observation cost is small. Based on the results, we can design very energy-efficient wireless sensor networks by using censoring and on-off sensors.},

	abstract = {A critical design issue for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is the development of medium access control (MAC) protocols that efficiently reduce power consumption. WSNs sensor nodes are generally powered by batteries which provide a limited amount of energy, and it is often difficult to recharge or replace batteries. Therefore power aware and energy efficient MAC protocols at each layer of the communications are very essential for wireless sensor networks. Fairness to both the usage of a channel and messages may also be traded as for improved power consumptions. In case of classical antennas, unfair channel allocation and wastage of channels between each node can be happened, which is directly affects throughput performance. On the other hand these can bring a problem such as MAC-deadlock, hidden and exposed terminal problem. To overcome these problems a directional antennas have been extensively used in designing MAC protocols for wireless sensor networks. Directional antennas provide many advantages over the classical antennas. These advantages include spatial reuse channel and increases in coverage range distance. One of the main considerations in designing MAC protocols for static wireless sensor networks is to reduce power consumption at the sensor nodes. This is usually done by imposing transmission and receiving schedules on the sensor nodes from only one side at same time. Since it is desirable for a sensor network to be self managed, these schedules need to be worked out by individual nodes in a distributed fashion. In this paper, we show that directional antennas can be used effectively to solve a common hidden and exposed terminal problem by using an energy efficient MAC protocol for wireless sensor networks. This directional Antenna could be rotated in case of base station node to avoid directional hidden terminal problem. Our MAC protocol conserves energy at the nodes by calculating a scheduling strategy at individual nodes and by avoiding packet collisi- - ons almost completely.},

We propose a novel kernel-based approach in graphical model learning for wireless sensor networks to minimize the number of training samples of real sensor data needed. We demonstrate the proposed approach by simulations using real-world wireless sensor network data.

	abstract = {Wireless industrial sensor networks are wireless sensor networks which have been adapted to industrial applications. Most techniques for wireless sensor networks can be applied to wireless industrial sensor networks. However, for industrial applications of wireless industrial sensor networks, new requirements such as real-time, reliable delivery need to be considered. In this paper, we propose EARQ, which is a novel routing protocol for wireless industrial sensor networks. It provides real-time, reliable delivery of a packet, while considering energy awareness. In EARQ, a node estimates the energy cost, delay and reliability of a path to the sink node, based only on information from neighboring nodes. Then, it calculates the probability of selecting a path, using the estimates. When packet forwarding is required, it randomly selects the next node. A path with lower energy cost is likely to be selected, because the probability is inversely proportional to the energy cost to the sink node. To achieve real-time delivery, only paths that may deliver a packet in time are selected. To achieve reliability, it may send a redundant packet via an alternate path, but only if it is a source of a packet. Experimental results show that EARQ is suitable for industrial applications, due to its capability for energy efficient, real-time, reliable communications.},

	abstract = {Wireless sensor networks are often deployed over a large area of interest and therefore the quality of the sensor signals may vary significantly across the different sensors. In this case, it is useful to have a measure for the importance or the so-called ``utility'' of each sensor, e.g., for sensor subset selection, resource allocation or topology selection. In this paper, we consider the efficient calculation of sensor utility measures for four different signal estimation or beamforming algorithms in an adaptive context. We use the definition of sensor utility as the increase in cost (e.g., mean-squared error) when the sensor is removed from the estimation procedure. Since each possible sensor removal corresponds to a new estimation problem (involving less sensors), calculating the sensor utilities would require a continuous updating of K different signal estimators (where K is the number of sensors), increasing computational complexity and memory usage by a factor K. However, we derive formulas to efficiently calculate all sensor utilities with hardly any increase in memory usage and computational complexity compared to the signal estimation algorithm already in place. When applied in adaptive signal estimation algorithms, this allows for on-line tracking of all the sensor utilities at almost no additional cost. Furthermore, we derive efficient formulas for sensor removal, i.e., for updating the signal estimator coefficients when a sensor is removed, e.g., due to a failure in the wireless link or when its utility is too low. We provide a complexity evaluation of the derived formulas, and demonstrate the significant reduction in computational complexity compared to straightforward implementations.},

Many applications of wireless sensor networks are useful only when connected to an external network. Previous research on transport layer protocols for sensor networks has focused on designing protocols specifically targeted for sensor networks. The deployment of TCP/IP in sensor networks would, however, enable direct connection between the sensor network and external TCP/IP networks. In this paper we focus on the performance of TCP in the context of wireless sensor networks. TCP is known to exhibit poor performance in wireless environments, both in terms of throughput and energy efficiency. To overcome these problems we introduce a mechanism called TCP segment caching .We show by simulation that TCP segment caching significantly improves TCP performance so that TCP can be useful even in wireless sensor networks.},

The handoff events occur at a much higher rate in sectored cellular networks than in traditional cellular systems. An efficient bandwidth reservation mechanism for the neighboring cells is therefore critical in the process of handoff during the connection of multimedia calls to avoid the unwillingly forced termination and waste of limited bandwidth in the sectored cellular communications, particularly when the handoff traffic is heavy. A self-adaptive bandwidth reservation scheme which employs a neural fuzzy bandwidth-reserving estimator, is proposed, and the simulation results show that our scheme can achieve superior performance than traditional fixed bandwidth-reserving scheme in sectored cellular networks when performance metrics are measured in terms of the new call blocking probability and the forced termination probability.},

Mobility of users and scarcity of bandwidth makes QoS provisioning a difficult task in cellular networks. In this paper, a call admission control (CAC) and resource reservation mechanism (RR) is described to provide a consistent QoS guarantee in cellular mobile networks and we propose an idea to improve it. This mechanism is based on user mobility profile which is effectively used for path prediction. The previous behavior of mobile users are collected and analyzed for generating mobility profiles. We add variable bandwidth allocation and bandwidth borrowing strategy to mobility prediction for improving the evaluation metrics. Our method guarantees that the bandwidth allocated to a real-time call never drops below the minimum bandwidth requirement of the call ensuring that the corresponding application can still function at an acceptable level.

	abstract = {To facilitate a viable evolution of cellular networks toward extensive packet data traffic, the High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) technology is introduced. The various link adaptation techniques employed by HSDPA augment the bandwidth variation, which is identified as one of the most important factors resulting in the deterioration of TCP performance. In this paper, we firstly build an analytical model of TCP throughput to explain why the bandwidth variation degrades the TCP performance. Subsequently, a split-connection Window Adaptation TCP Proxy is proposed to improve the TCP throughput in HSDPA networks. To use the precious cellular link resources sufficiently, the length of the queue in Node-B is intentionally kept around the reference value through adaptively adjusting the sending window size of TCP proxy based on the dynamic values of varying bandwidth. Since both the disturbance caused by bandwidth variation and the feedback delay are prone to lead an unstable queue system, the robust sliding mode variable structure control theory is employed to design the proper control law to weaken the impact of noise and delay on the stability of the queue system in Node-B. The theoretical analysis and the enhanced scheme are verified through simulation experiments. The simulation results show that our TCP proxy is able to resist against bandwidth oscillation and improve the cellular link utilization.},

In this paper, an adaptive framework for supporting multiple classes of multimedia services with different QoS requirements in wireless cellular networks is proposed. The framework combines the following components: (1) a threshold-based bandwidth allocation policy that gives priority to handoff calls over new calls and prioritizes among different classes of handoff calls by assigning a threshold to each class; (2) an efficient threshold-type call admission control (CAC) algorithm; and (3) a bandwidth adaptation algorithm (BAA) that dynamically adjusts the bandwidth of ongoing multimedia calls to minimize the number of calls receiving lower bandwidth than they had requested.

The additional workload from handoff clients could exceed the network capacity of a cell and seriously affect the effectiveness of the adopted admission control mechanism in maintaining the quality of services provided to the admitted clients. To minimize the number of forced terminations of real-time video playback in handoff clients, we include buffered bandwidth in the admission test for handoff clients. With the use of buffered bandwidth, we can balance the video workload amongst the cells to minimize the impact of overloading as the result of handoff operations. In serving video requests from the mobile clients in a cell, we aim to maintain fairness in services especially under overload situations as the requested videos from different types of clients could generate very different workload. Schemes to maintain the fairness in admission and bandwidth allocation in serving the video requests in a cell are discussed.},

With respect to this great increment, service providers should be able to serve all the subscribers with reasonable quality of service (QoS). It should be considered that different users, request various services which have different requirements, for example delay-sensitive and non-delay-sensitive services. In order to provide all the requirements, researchers have proposed new methods. In a number of methods, bandwidth degradation schemes have been suggested to limit the dropping rate of delay-sensitive requests by the degradation of the assigned bandwidth to the active connections. In this paper, one of these schemes is analyzed and its properties are carefully verified. Also, a measure is proposed to explain the cost of bandwidth degradation scheme. It is described that the cost of the bandwidth degradation scheme should be less than the cost of undesirable dropping in the cells, in order to employ bandwidth degradation schemes efficiently.},

An admission control scheme is also considered to further guarantee the quality of service (QoS) of real-time traffic. The area of a cell is divided into non-reservation zone (NRZ), reservation zone (RZ), and handoff zone (HZ) to ensure that bandwidth is reserved in the target cell as mobile terminals (MTs) move into the RZ and leaves the NRZ. The amount of bandwidth to be reserved is dynamically adjusted according to the location and direction of MT. The performance of the system is evaluated through discrete-event simulation of a realistic cellular environment. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme reduces the new call blocking probability (NCBP), handoff call dropping probability (HCDP) and reduces the probability of terminated calls and cancel reservation based on location and current direction of MTs. An enhanced resource reservation is achieved as compared to the existing schemes developed to address the limiting factors in bandwidth reservation.},

Accordingly, if the amount of occupied bandwidth exceeds a bandwidth threshold Bt, new calls are blocked. The novelty of our scheme is based on observing the elapsed time of data handoff calls and according to a time threshold parameter, handoff calls can either be prioritized or treated as new calls.

	abstract = {Channel-reservation techniques have been widely studied in cellular networks in order to meet the desired quality-of-service requirements. In this paper, a distributed predictive channel-reservation scheme, called the road-map-based channel-reservation scheme (RMCR), and a call-admission-control algorithm are proposed. The goal is to reduce the handoff-dropping probability and to improve the bandwidth utilization. In the RMCR scheme, we assume that base stations (BSs) are equipped with road-map information and that mobile stations (MSs) are equipped with global positioning systems (GPS) devices. MSs periodically report their GPS location information to their BSs. Based on the location information of the MSs at two consecutive epochs, the BSs estimate the speed and moving direction of the MSs. Furthermore, the BSs estimate the probability that the MSs will enter the neighboring cells based on their velocity and the road-map information stored in the BSs. The BSs then compute the amount of bandwidth to be reserved, based on such estimation. With the road-map information, the BSs can make a more-accurate prediction on the user's mobility and, hence, reduce unnecessary bandwidth reservation. Simulation results show that RMCR is capable of keeping the handoff-dropping probability low and allocating bandwidth to new/handoff calls efficiently. We also show that RMCR is robust with respect to system parameters such as user's speed, the density of roads, the accuracy of mobility measurement, and so on.},

To be able to use the solution, we provide a mechanism for constructing the arrival/residence time distribution based on the measurement of hand-off events in a cell.

In this paper, we consider such a problem in a hybrid wireless network installed in a superstore environment and design a bandwidth management algorithm based on the priority level, classification of the incoming transactions.

The priority of real time traffic is higher than that of non-real time traffic. Since bandwidth is limited, it must be allocated in advance to guarantee the throughput of real time traffic in WiMAX network. But WiMAX standard does not provide any algorithm for dynamic allocation of bandwidth to these services. In this paper, a dynamic bandwidth allocation algorithm for WiMAX called Efficient Bandwidth Management (EBM) is proposed. In EBM the bandwidth will be increased in the upcoming frames when the allocated bandwidth is not sufficient to transfer the data. On the other side if the allocated bandwidth is more, then the bandwidth will be decreased in the upcoming frames so that the other services can use this excess bandwidth. This bandwidth increase or decrease is proportional to the remaining data in the queue. EBM increase the throughput of real time traffic as the bandwidth is handled efficiently. The proposed algorithm is implemented in ns-2 and results are compared with traditional IEEE 802.16 WiMAX. The simulation results show that EBM algorithm gives better result for real-time traffic.},

A self-management module is implemented in each node of the network.

Accordingly, it smoothes abrupt differences in bandwidth availability along possible paths, which are frequently due to static settings of bandwidth constraints. Due to the distributed nature of the proposed solution, the adjustments can be frequently introduced, allowing for a quick adaptation of the network to the traffic changes.

The uplink bandwidth management in WiMAX networks is one of the important issues that requires effectively allocating the bandwidth among contending users according to their services. In this paper, an efficient bandwidth management scheme, named WiMAX Dynamic Channel Allocation Scheme (WDCAS), is proposed. The scheme uses the cognitive radio for dynamic channel allocation in order to improve the bandwidth utilization while satisfying the QoS requirements. A queuing model based on the maximum entropy principle for performance analysis is introduced, and closed-form expressions for the state probability and the blocking probability are obtained.

In particular, handling the shortage of network bandwidth is one of the most significant and complicated problems. In this paper, a real-time streaming management middleware named as RTSM middleware is suggested as a solution to the problem regarding the IEEE1394-based home network. In order to handle the shortage of network bandwidth and enhance the bus utilization rate, the proposed middleware combines two methods. First, the bandwidth management function measures the usage rate of network bandwidth and restores the residual bandwidth, which is excessively occupied by a streaming service, to free bandwidth. Second, the isochronous streaming (IS) scheduler manages all streaming services in a network according to a priority-based preemptive scheduling policy. This paper focuses on explaining the necessity of bandwidth management in home networks and describing the prototype architecture of the proposed middleware. Evaluation result will show the potential possibility of the proposed middleware.},

	abstract = {When designing and configuring an ATM-based B-ISDN, it remains difficult to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) for different service classes, while still allowing enough statistical sharing of bandwidth so that the network is efficiently utilized. These two goals are often conflicting. Guaranteeing QoS requires traffic isolation, as well as allocation of enough network resources (e.g., buffer space and bandwidth) to each call. However, statistical bandwidth sharing means the network resources should be occupied on demand, leading to less traffic isolation and minimal resource allocation. The authors address this problem by proposing and evaluating a network-wide bandwidth management framework in which an appropriate compromise between the two conflicting goals is achieved. Specifically, the bandwidth management framework consists of a network model and a network-wide bandwidth allocation and sharing strategy. Implementation issues related to the framework are discussed. For real-time applications the authors obtain maximum queuing delay and queue length, which are important in buffer design and VP (virtual path) routing},

Under the highly variable wireless environment, the existing bandwidth management schemes result in more frequent quality changes for active flows than necessary, which are undesirable and intolerant to multimedia real-time applications. The proposed scheme is designed to provide high bandwidth utilization efficiency and low call blocking probability with minimum QoS fluctuation. In order to minimize the impact of bandwidth change for the QoS of existing flows, a controlled bandwidth degradation algorithm is performed when the free bandwidth in a cell isn't enough to admit a new flow. Compared with existing schemes, our scheme reduces the probability of frequent quality changes and provides more satisfactory services for higher priority flows. The performance analysis has shown that, under the same network load, our proposed scheme outperforms existing ones with lower QoS degradation probability.},

Accurate management of bandwidth allocations with a goal of maximizing the revenues is quite complex, due to the interactions among various data flows that dynamically share the network bandwidth. We adopt a heuristics-aided control strategy that iteratively adjusts the bandwidth allocation based on the observed packet loss rate and delays. The paper first demonstrates the existence of a globally optimal operating point that minimizes the total bandwidth cost over a large number of flows while keeping the end-to-end packet delays within a prescribed limit. We then provide an algorithmic framework to search for this optimal point with an imprecise knowledge of the overall system model. Our optimization strategy for the QoS adaptation problem offers a unified management framework that considers both the bandwidth cost and the end-user QoS - and is hence useful for connectivity service providers.},

The RG translates communication protocols, coordinates information sharing and serves as a gateway to external networks for integrated multimedia entertainment, on-line services, home security, home automation, information exchange and data storage. Modern home network applications especially for real-time are demanding guaranteed quality of service (QoS) for bounded network bandwidth resources. In order to initiate a DiffServ-QoS (differentiated services-QoS) bandwidth management mechanism during network congestion, this paper proposes a QRG (QoS-aware residential gateway) with both real-time traffic monitoring, DiffServ-QoS and CBQ bandwidth management. Firstly, QRG classifies traffic flow into separate types, with specialized treatment per traffic type to optimize compliance with user-specified priorities. Applications with higher priority get the right to deliver first. Additionally, QRG with built-in traffic control function adopts class based queuing (CBQ) as DiffServ-QoS bandwidth/traffic management for optimized use of bounded network resources. QRG is experimentally implemented on a Linux platform. High-end application is simulated by hosting QRG in a general-purpose PC, while minimum-cost modular application is simulated by hosting QRG in a light-weight low-power ARM920T embedded system. Results show that in both implementations, QRG successfully performs DiffServ-QoS and CBQ bandwidth management functions so that good quality of service and video performance are maintained during network congestion.},

	abstract = {As service providers move more applications to their IP/MPLS (multiple protocol label switching ) backbone networks, rapid restoration upon failure becomes more and more crucial. Recently MPLS fast reroute has attracted lots of attention as it was designed to meet the needs of real-time applications, such as voice over IP. MPLS fast reroute achieves rapid restoration by computing and signaling backup label switched path (LSP) tunnels in advance and re-directing traffic as close to failure point as possible. To provide a guarantee of bandwidth protection, extra bandwidth has to be reserved on backup paths. Using path merging technique as described in IETF RFC 4090 only, the network is able to share some bandwidth on common links among backup paths of the same service LSP, i.e., so-called intra-sharing. But no solution is provided on how to share bandwidth among backup paths of different service LSPs, i.e., so-called inter-sharing. In this paper, we provide an efficient distributed bandwidth management solution. This solution allows bandwidth sharing among backup paths of the same and different service LSPs, i.e., both intra-sharing and inter-sharing, with a guarantee of bandwidth protection for any single node/link failure. We also propose an efficient algorithm for backup path selection with the associated signaling extensions for additional information distribution and collection. To evaluate our schemes, we compare them via simulation with the basic MPLS fast reroute proposal, IETF RFC 4090, on two networks. Our simulation results show that using our bandwidth management scheme can significantly reduce restoration overbuild from about 250\% to about 100\%, and our optimized backup path selection can further reduce restoration overbuild to about 60\%.},

The first one, named bandwidth preemption algorithm, dedicated for the maximum allocation model and in which preemption is conducted in two dimensions: Class Type and priority levels within a same CT. Furthermore, we design a second algorithm named LSP preemption algorithm to select the most appropriate LSPs to be cast out. Selection decision is made on the basis of several criteria: the precedence level, the number of LSPs to preempt and the excess of bandwidth to gain. Extensive simulation study is carried out to evaluate the performance of our approach. Compared with existing ones, our algorithm improves not only bandwidth efficiency but also robustness and fairness. It achieves significant performance improvement for the well-behaving traffic classes in term of bandwidth link utilization, bandwidth blocking,and LSPs preemption.},

	abstract = {Distributed weighted fair scheduling schemes for QoS support in wireless networks have not yet become standard. In this paper we propose an admission control and dynamic bandwidth management scheme that provides fairness in the absence of distributed link level weighted fair scheduling. In case weighted fair scheduling becomes available, our system assists it by supplying the scheduler with weights and adjusting them dynamically as network and traffic characteristics vary. To obtain these weights, we convert the bandwidth requirement of the application into a channel time requirement. Our bandwidth manager then allots each flow a share of the channel time depending on its requirement relative to the requirements of other flows in the network. It uses a max-min fairness algorithm with minimum guarantees. The flow controls its packet transmission rate so it only occupies the channel for the fraction of time allotted to it by the bandwidth manager. As available bandwidth in the network and the traffic characteristics of various flows change, the channel time proportion allotted also dynamically varies. Our experiments show that, at the cost of a very low overhead, there is a high probability that every flow in the network will receive at least its minimum requested share of the network bandwidth.},

An analytic maximum entropy (ME) model is proposed for the cost-effective performance evaluation of the two bandwidth management schemes associated with networks with a large number of stations and/or the connections. In this context, an open queueing network model (QNM) is devised, consisting of interacting queues with multiple service classes and closed form expressions for the state and blocking probability distributions are derived. Typical numerical examples are employed to verify the credibility of the analytic ME solutions against simulation results at 95\% confidence intervals.

The on-chip cache resources are limited and in many situations, cannot hold the working set of the threads running on all these cores. This situation makes DRAM bandwidth a critical shared resource. Existing DRAM bandwidth management schemes provide support for enforcing bandwidth shares but have problems like starvation, complexity, and unpredictable DRAM access latency. In this paper, we propose a DRAM bandwidth management scheme with two key features. First, the scheme avoids unexpected long latencies or starvation of memory requests. It also allows OS to select the right combination of performance and strength of bandwidth share enforcement. Second, it provides a feedback-driven policy that adoptively tunes the bandwidth shares to achieve desired average latencies for memory accesses. This feature is useful under high contention and can be used to provide performance level support for critical applications or to support service level agreements for enterprise computing data centers.},

Even with the substantial increase in the supported bandwidth in next generation Broadband Wireless Access Systems (BWASs), it is expected that these systems will severely suffer from congestion due to the rapid increase in demand of bandwidth intensive applications. Without efficient bandwidth management and congestion control schemes, network operators may not be able to meet the increasing demand of users for multimedia services, and hence they may suffer immense amount of revenue loss. In this paper, we propose an admission-level bandwidth management scheme consisting of Call Admission Control (CAC) and dynamic pricing. The main aim of our proposed scheme is to provide monetary incentives to users to use the wireless resources efficiently and rationally, hence, allowing efficient bandwidth management at the admission level. By dynamically determining the prices of units of bandwidth, the proposed scheme can guarantee that the arrival rates to the system are less than or equal to the optimal ones computed dynamically, hence, guaranteeing a congestion-free system.

The tutorial describes the needs for the three types of policy rules: class-based bandwidth limitation, session-bandwidth guarantee, and inter/intra-class bandwidth borrowing. The survey portion investigates how the eight chosen commercial/open-source real systems enforce the three policy types. To evaluate the techniques, the designed testbed emulates real-life Internet conditions, such as many simultaneous sessions from different IPs/ports, controllable wide area network (WAN) delay and packet loss rate for each session, and different TCP source implementations. The performance metrics include accuracy of bandwidth management, fairness among sessions, robustness under Internet packet losses and different operating systems, inter/intra-class bandwidth borrowing, and voice over IP (VoIP) quality. The black-box test results demonstrate that (1) only the combination of CBQ+PFQ+TCR can solve the most difficult scenario (multiple sessions competing for the narrow 20kb/s class); (2) the TCR approach may degrade the goodput, fairness, and compatibility even under slight packet loss rates (0.5 percent); (3) without PFQ, TCR and RED have limited ability to isolate the sessions (especially for RED); (4) the G.729 VoIP quality over a 125kb/s access link becomes good only after exercising MSS-clamping to shrink the packet size of the background traffic down to 256 byte.},

	abstract = {The Internet architecture uses congestion avoidance mechanisms implemented in the transport layer protocol like TCP to provide good service under heavy load. If network nodes distribute bandwidth fairly, the Internet would be more robust and accommodate a wide variety of applications. Various congestion and bandwidth management schemes have been proposed for this purpose and can be classified into two broad categories: packet scheduling algorithms such as fair queueing (FQ) which explicitly provide bandwidth shares by scheduling packets. They are more difficult to implement compared to FIFO queueing. The second category has active queue management schemes such as RED which use FIFO queues at the routers. They are easy to implement but don't aim to provide (and, in the presence of non-congestion-responsive sources, don't provide) fairness. An algorithm called AFD (approximate fair dropping), has been proposed to provide approximate, weighted max-min fair bandwidth allocations with relatively low complexity. AFD has since been widely adopted by the industry. This paper describes the evolution of AFD from a research project into an industry setting, focusing on the changes it has undergone in the process. AFD now serves as a traffic management module, which can be implemented either using a single FIFO or overlaid on top of extant per-flow queueing structures and which provides approximate bandwidth allocation in a simple fashion. The AFD algorithm has been implemented in several switch and router platforms at Cisco sytems, successfully transitioning from the academic world into the industry.},

	abstract = {Growth in the usage of mobile Internet services has complicated quality of service (QoS) management in cellular multimedia networks due to four objectives: maximum system efficiency in bandwidth utilization; enhanced user-perceived QoS level in terms of system protection ratio; maximum system capacity for accommodating ever increasing traffic load; least handoff rate because every handoff interrupts the negotiated QoS parameters and thus affects the application performance to an extent that depends on the period of induced interruption and type of application. Considering a GSM 900 based cellular multimedia network model, the dependency of system efficiency on the diversity of multimedia calls and handoff rate is first established; then, having determined an optimized value of protection ratio, it is established that, regardless of protection ratio value, the system's capacity depends upon the employed MAC (medium access control) protocol and handoff rate. Having confirmed numerical results by using LABVIEW 6.0 simulation software, it is concluded that, for any desired QoS level, the cellular multimedia network management requires intelligent optimization of the system efficiency and the system capacity that also depends on the employed MAC protocol and handoff rate.},

The CNNU-based scheduler determines a radio resource assignment vector for all connections so that the overall system utility is maximized and the system throughput can be achieved as high as possible.

This makes it possible that there are the increasing numbers of new multimedia calls and non-prioritized handoff multimedia calls which can successfully occupies bandwidth units in ATTSM when carried traffic is heavier. The ATTSM increases service provider satisfaction by improving the bandwidth utilizations at the cost of increasing the prioritized multimedia handoff call dropping probabilities that may tolerate uncritical dropping compared with Fixed Time-Threshold-based bandwidth allocation Scheme (FTTSM). Simulation results validate the superiority of ATTSM over FTTSM. Hence, the proposed scheme provides good QoS guarantees for both mobile multimedia users and the service provider.},

	abstract = {The next generation cellular wireless network is expected to provide a broad range of multimedia services, where the traffic asymmetry between uplink and downlink is significant. The code division multiple access system with time division duplex mode (TDD-CDMA), adopting unbalanced slot allocation between uplink and downlink, is a good solution for this traffic asymmetry. Here a QoS adaptive multimedia service framework is proposed to control the multimedia traffic in TDD-CDMA cellular wireless networks. The scheme operates at the connection-level where the CDMA code of ongoing call can be dynamically changed to provide an acceptable trade off level between connection blocking and dropping probabilities for different traffic class. The proposed scheme is designed to take advantage of the adaptive code allocation algorithm in order to enhance the system utilization, and blocking \& dropping probabilities of calls. Although orthogonal variable frequency spreading (OVSF) code is used in simulation here, the paramount interest is on algorithm that allows optimum use of TDD-CDMA resources i.e. code and time slots. Simulation result shows that on the expense of resource allocated to non real-time services, the call dropping and blocking rate for real-time services can be minimized.},

Participation in multimedia conferences in MCNs may be confined to either the conventional cellular network or the MANET. Participation also can span both networks. However, neither the media-handling architectures currently in use in conventional cellular networks, nor the ones in use in MANETs are appropriate. When they are used, either the participants in the conventional cellular network, or the ones in the MANETs, might experience long and potentially unacceptable end-to-end stream delays. Furthermore, these architectures are the antipodes of each other. Reconciling them is not an easy task. We evaluate the architectures currently in use in cellular networks and MANETs, show that none is suitable, and propose a new architecture that bridges the two worlds. The new architecture uses the MANET media-handling architectures as a starting point. It is based on media mediators. A media mediator is composed of two functional entities: the media gateway controller mediator and the media gateway mediator. A proof-of-concept prototype was implemented, and extensive simulations were conducted to evaluate performance.},

The analytical model is based on continuous-time multidimensional birth-death processes, and it is focused on just one of the cells in the network. The cellular system is assumed to provide three classes of service: the basic voice service, a data service with bit rate higher than the voice service and a multimedia service with one voice and one data component. In order to improve the overall network performance, some channels can be reserved to handovers, and multimedia calls that cannot complete a handover are decoupled, by transferring to the target cell only the voice component and suspending the data connection until a sufficient number of channels becomes free. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of the approximate model, as well as the effectiveness of the newly proposed multimedia call decoupling approach},

An understanding of such bounds would greatly enhance the ability of service providers to offer multimedia based applications over cellular networks. For simplicity, we consider only two types of multimedia signals, with single demand for each type at each node in a 2-band buffering environment, where interference does not extend beyond two cells. Our approach considers the feasibility of assignment at each node, based on all previously assigned channels to its neighbors. The derived lower bounds are tighter than the one reported in the literature, with an improvement of the bounds by about 17\% under typical situations.},

Therefore, the demand for effective and careful resource allocation is immensely needed. In this paper, we combine call admission control (CAC) and adaptation bandwidth allocation (ABA) algorithm into a novel framework, which we call adaptive QoS (Ad-QoS) for provisioning connection-level QoS in multimedia wireless cellular networks (MWCN). Simulation results show that the framework is able to reduce Handoff connection dropping probability (HCDP) for active users of real time services to zero level. Thus, it satisfies mobile users' needs resulting in a stable performance levels during heavy load periods. Furthermore, the framework provides a low new connection blocking probability (NCBP), which translates into high resource utilization. This is a highly desirable property from the service provider point of view},

Because future data service will occupy a large portion of all services in next generation mobile networks, there is much significance in improving handoff data call dropping probabilities of adaptive time-threshold-based bandwidth allocation scheme for multimedia services (ATTSM) further. The proposed scheme uses handoff queuing for data service according to the queuing discipline which is the least maximum handoff tolerance degradation interval first out and then, modifies priority definition and bandwidth allocation of ATTSM in order to guarantee QoS of voice service. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves performances of handoff data dropping probabilities at the cost of slightly increasing new call blocking probabilities and the prioritized handoff voice dropping probability that may tolerate uncritical while keeping high total bandwidth utilization compared with ATTSM.},

(2003) the authors have developed call admission control and adaptive bandwidth allocation schemes for serving multimedia connections in cellular wireless networks with fixed cell capacity. The architecture considers an adaptive networking framework where the bandwidth of multimedia calls can be dynamically adjusted, and the proposed admission method works by enforcing an upper bound on the cell overload probability. In this paper we consider a similar adaptive framework, and devise call admission control and bandwidth allocation strategies to serve multimedia connections in a CDMA-based 3G cellular network. The architecture aims at maintaining the session's quality during both intra-cell and inter-cell user movements by limiting the cell overload probability. A novel aspect of our work is a method for exploiting a priori knowledge of user mobility patterns to estimate the cell overload probability after some prescribed prediction interval. Important properties of the devised method are proved analytically. Compared to a non-predictive admission control scheme, the obtained results show that the proposed scheme achieves a lower forced termination probability, and higher throughput while consuming less base station transmission energy},

This paper presents a novel method for QoS provisioning via the use of the average reward reinforcement learning, which can maximize the network revenue subject to several predetermined QoS constraints. By considering handoff dropping probability, average allocated bandwidth and intraclass fairness simultaneously, our algorithm formulation guarantees that these QoS parameters are kept within predetermined constraints. Unlike other model-based algorithms, our scheme does not require explicit state transition probabilities and therefore the assumptions behind the underlying system model are more realistic than those in previous schemes. Moreover, by considering the status of neighboring cells, the proposed scheme can dynamically adapt to changes in traffic condition.

(2) We propose a novel privacy metric to quantify system's resilience to such attack models. (3) An effective and extensible privacy architecture based on the mix zone model is designed. (4) We conduct rigorous analytical study, and design a privacy protection mechanism under real world constraints, e.g., traffic density and heterogeneity on different roads.

	abstract = {Privacy requirements for mobile applications offer a distinct set of challenges for requirements engineering. First, they are highly dynamic, changing over time and locations, and across the different roles of agents involved and the kinds of information that may be disclosed. Second, although some general privacy requirements can be elicited a priori, users often refine them at runtime as they interact with the system and its environment. Selectively disclosing information to appropriate agents is therefore a key privacy management challenge, requiring carefully formulated privacy requirements amenable to systematic reasoning. In this paper, we introduce privacy arguments as a means of analysing privacy requirements in general and selective disclosure requirements (that are both content- and context-sensitive) in particular. Privacy arguments allow individual users to express personal preferences, which are then used to reason about privacy for each user under different contexts. At runtime, these arguments provide a way to reason about requirements satisfaction and diagnosis. Our proposed approach is demonstrated and evaluated using the privacy requirements of BuddyTracker, a mobile application we developed as part of our overall research programme.},

	abstract = {The advancement of technology in mobile devices places South African (SA) banking institutions in unique positions to leverage these advancements into innovative value added services. Mobile banking is one such innovation that has afforded banking clients the ability to, amongst other services, view bank statements, pay bills, and transfer money. Despite a growing trend in mobile banking service offerings by SA banks, privacy and security issues are still considered a concern. The paper conceptualizes the underlying concerns by bank clients regarding the adoption of mobile banking services. Privacy Calculus Theory (PCT) has been used as a theoretical lens to explain the cognitive process involved when a potential mobile banking subscriber is presented with mobile banking technology solutions. The paper extends PCT by abstracting the risk/benefit trade-off psyche held by SA bank clients. The paper attempts to explain, using PCT, the bank clients' cognitive process and willingness to subscribe to mobile banking services. Quantitative research method has been used for this purpose. Purposeful sampling that targeted SA bank-account holders was applied. Empirical results show that the South African banked consumers' psyche is largely influenced by the utility of a technology (mobile banking service) and interestingly, privacy and security play a lesser role in this trade-off.},

In this paper, we survey mobile SNAs available today and we analyze their privacy designs using feedback and control framework on information capture, construction, accessibility, and purposes. Our analysis results suggest that today's mobile SNAs need better privacy protection on construction and accessibility, to handle increasingly popular mash-ups between different SNA sites.

	abstract = {Mobile telephony (e.g., Global System for Mobile Communications [GSM]) is today's most common communication solution. Due to the specific characteristics of mobile communication infrastructure, it can provide real added value to the user and various other parties. Location information and mobility patterns of subscribers contribute not only to emergency planning, general safety, and security, but are also a driving force for new commercial services. However, there is a lack of transparency in today's mobile telephony networks regarding location disclosure. Location information is generated, collected, and processed without being noticed by subscribers. Hence, by exploiting subscriber location information, an individual's privacy is threatened. We develop a utility-based opponent model to formalize the conflict between the additional utility of mobile telephony infrastructure being able to locate subscribers and the individual's privacy. Based on these results, measures were developed to improve an individual's location privacy through a user-controllable GSM software stack. To analyze and evaluate the effects of specific subscriber provider interaction, a dedicated test environment will be presented, using the example of GSM mobile telephony networks. The resulting testbed is based on real-life hardware and open-source software to create a realistic and defined environment that includes all aspects of the air interface in mobile telephony networks and thus, is capable of controlling subscriber-provider interaction in a defined and fully controlled environment.},

Privacy in location based systems is addressed in many papers. Our work is focused on the trusted third party privacy framework that utilizes the concept of k-anonymity with or without l-diversity. In previous anonymization models k may be defined as a personalization parameter of the mobile user or as uniform system parameter for all mobile users . Clearly, k other users may not be available at the time of request in these systems. These requests are discarded because the quality of service (QoS) they require cannot be satisfied. In this paper we introduce a novel suite of algorithms called MobiPriv that guarantees a 100\% success rate of processing a mobile request using k-anonymity with diversity considerations. We evaluated our suite of algorithms experimentally against previously proposed anonymization algorithms using real world traffic volume data, real world road network and mobile users generated realistically by a mobile object generator.},

	abstract = {Mobile devices are becoming the largest sensor network around the world. They could be used to collect a large amount of data with little effort and cost which is leading to a promising future for participatory sensing networks or urban sensing. However, privacy concerns of the mobile users are the major inhibitors hindering massive participation. This paper proposes a solution to user privacy preserving problem in a participatory sensing network. Each user is considered as a node in a social network and users are connected through friendship links which are represented as edges on the network. Typically, each user contributes to the participatory system by uploading his/her acquired data to a server. Instead of uploading data to the server directly, we devised a Hot-Potato-Privacy-Protection Algorithm (H P3) in which data is sent to one of the friends of the user and the friend will choose another friend to deliver the data to the next hop. Hopping goes on until some user-defined threshold is reached, then the last user uploads the data to the server. Friend selection is random and the number of hops is also random and independent. H P3 ensures that the probability that the server can make a successful attack on the data owner is no better than 1/n where n is the number of mobile users in the system. Therefore, H P3 protects location privacy as well as data ownership privacy of mobile users. We simulate our approach on some large scale social networks and report some findings in the paper. Experiments show that our system achieves privacy protection for each user against the server with tolerable communication overhead.},

	abstract = {With the growing demand for data-sensitive applications employing mobile devices, such as mobile clinics in remote villages and remote sensors collecting sensitive data, there is a need for a new architectural paradigm for mobile data management. Typically, these mobile devices have limited storage and processing capabilities, and operate in unreliable environments leading to possible loss of valuable data, if not properly managed. Often, the collected data is periodically offloaded to a remote server such as a cloud. However, such offloading may lead to violation of privacy if the network/server cannot be fully trusted. While encrypting the data prior to offloading appears to be a solution for this problem, this is computationally intensive and infeasible when mobile devices are employed. In this paper, we propose a partial-encryption scheme that takes into account both the privacy (confidentiality) constraints of the data being collected and the limitations of the mobile devices. The scheme employs vertical and horizontal fragmentation to determine those parts that need to be encrypted and those that can be sent in clear. The privacy constraints are represented in terms of a constraint graph and two-coloring problem solution is applied to identify the portions of the data that need to be encrypted. Any cycles in the constraint graph are handled using heuristics. The approach is effective in integrating unsecured wireless/internet with the untrusted yet cheap cloud storage servers, using the capacity-constrained mobile devices to manage sensitive data.},

	abstract = {How to protect location privacy of mobile users is an important issue in ubiquitous computing. However, location privacy protection is particularly challenging: on one hand, the administration requires all legitimate users to provide identity information in order to grant them permission to use its wireless service; on the other hand, mobile users would prefer not to expose any information that could enable anyone, including the administration, to get some clue regarding their whereabouts; mobile users would like to have complete personal control of their location privacy. To address this issue, we propose an authorized-anonymous-ID-based scheme; this scheme effectively eliminates the need for a trusted server or administration, which is assumed in the previous work. Our key weapon is a cryptographic technique called blind signature, which is used to generate an authorized anonymous ID that replaces the real ID of an authorized mobile device. With authorized anonymous IDs, we design an architecture capable of achieving complete personal control over location privacy while maintaining the authentication function required by the administration.},

	abstract = {As Internet protocol (IP)-based protocols move toward becoming the prevalent means for providing new forms of communication, for example, using IP for communication traditionally done via public Switched telephone network (PSTN), location privacy of mobile end users becomes an important problem to address. In an IP network, each packet carries IP addresses corresponding to the source (sender) and the destination (receiver) of the packet. Mobile hosts (laptop computers, PDAs, mobile phones etc.) usually acquire temporary IP addresses from the address spaces allocated to the access networks where they are currently connected to the Internet, and use these addresses for communication over the Internet. Due to a strong correlation between the address spaces used by the access networks and the geographic location of the access networks, location privacy of mobile users is compromised. If the recipient or an intermediate network node in the path of the packet analyzes the packet, the location of the sender of the packet is revealed. This may affect the widespread acceptance of IP based protocols. In this paper we present a novel protocol called LocPriv that preserves the location privacy in an IP based mobile communication network. The protocol works by employing an IP address encapsulation/swapping scheme at the access nodes to conceal the IP address of the mobile host, without affecting the route that the packets should follow in the network. We compare the protocol with existing techniques for providing location privacy and also analyze the effect of the protocol on the complexity of routing elements.},

This paper presents the results of a survey of over 330 young people aged 18 to 25, which attempts to evaluate their use of mobile technology, their attitudes about security and privacy as it relates to mobile phones, as well as their perceptions of different ways how security and privacy could be improved in future mobile devices. Despite a commonly held belief that digital natives are technologically savvy, their self-assessment does not appear to support this statement. Furthermore, despite the respondents' awareness of various threats to security and privacy, very few of them actually take any concrete steps to protect their devices from unauthorized access.

In this system, QR Code is used to replace the traditional AR marker and the code can be tracked by the system without any maker registration procedure. This implies that the system is suitable for public domain applications since QR Code is a widely acceptable 2D barcode standard. Users can generate their codes and do not need to register the codes into the system. However, since every QR Code is different, to track the codes in a universal way a robust tracking technique needs to be applied. In this paper, we use the SIFT feature to enable QR Code tracking and also improve tracking accuracy and stability. We have developed this QR Code based AR system and its performance is encouraging. The code can be tracked efficiently with sufficient accuracy and stability.},

Run-length coding is applied to binary QR code image so as to accelerate the identification of QR code image. The QR code is transformed into many runs of data in alternate pixels of black and white. The related runs of data among adjacent rows are formed a unit module. After the whole image has been scanned, all of such modules in binary QR code image can be generated accordingly. With a noisy QR image captured by an industrial camera as an example, the experiments of image binarization, image seeking and localization adjustment are accomplished in sequence.

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new algorithm in reversible data hiding, with the application associated with the quick response (QR) codes. QR codes are random patterns, which can be commonly observed on the corner of posters or webpages. The goal of QR codes aims at convenienceoriented applications for mobile phone users. People can use the mobile phone cameras to capture QR code at the corner of web page, and then the hyperlink corresponding to the QR code can be accessed instantly. Since QR code looks like random noise and it occupies a corner of the original image, its existence can greatly reduce the value of the original content. Thus, how to retain the value of original image, while keeping the capability for the instant access for webpages, would be the major concern of this paper. With the aid of our reversible data hiding technique, the QR codes can be hidden into the original image, and considerable increase in embedding capacity can be expected. Next, we propose a scheme such that when the image containing the QR code is browsed, the hyperlink corresponding to the QR code is accessed first. Then, the QR code could get vanished and the original image would be recovered to retain the information conveyed therein. Simulation results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed algorithm.},

The encoding process used the DCT to allow QR Code image to be broken up into different frequency bands using block DCT based method; comparison between mid-band coefficients then embed with the invisible watermarking information into the middle frequency bands.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a method for low resolution QR-code recognition. A QR-code is a two-dimensional binary symbol that can embed various information such as characters and numbers. To recognize a QR-code correctly and stably, the resolution of an input image should be high. In practice, however, recognition of a QR-code is usually difficult due to low resolution when it is captured from a distance. In this paper, we propose a method to improve the performance of low resolution QR-code recognition by using the super-resolution technique that generates a high resolution image from multiple low-resolution images. Although a QR-code is a binary pattern, it is observed as a grayscale image due to the degradation through the capturing process. Especially the pixels around the borders between white and black regions become ambiguous. To overcome this problem, the proposed method introduces a binary pattern constraint to generate super-resolved images appropriate for recognition. Experimental results showed that a recognition rate of 98\% can be achieved by the proposed method, which is a 15.7\% improvement in comparison with a method using a conventional super-resolution method.},

QR code uses Reed-Solomon code which has error correction function, so a few images can be put on some appropriate positions of the code without damaging the implanted information; however it is hard to find such appropriate positions because they depend on QR code instances and images. The proposed system allows a user to capture his/her facial image with ease, to encode a sentence into a QR code, and to find good positions for the facial image on the code. Furthermore, the proposed system enables the user to choose the most desired design by iteratively selecting candidates the system displays. A simple experiment has shown that the proposed system makes a QR code decorated with a facial image within 10 to 20 minutes involving the time when a user thinks the implanted message and chooses a color.},

	abstract = {Since the introduction of QR Codes in the 90's, many companies have developed QR Code generators and mobile applications to read QR Codes. Despite the obvious benefits of next-generation data transfers, they have yet to be widely accepted and practiced. One of the main reasons is the use of unique language characters such as Arabic characters, Japanese Kanji, Thai Abugida and so forth. An attempt at embedding Arabic characters into QR Code for example, will result in the character's Unicode representation to be automatically encoded and/or decoded by default, instead of the original alphabet as a result of a method called Romanization. Thus, the intended use of the generated code has been useless. It is also noted that Romanization causes each character to be encoded in its own unique codeword which devours more space than encoding it with codeword for character combinations. In order to help solve this problem, this paper proposes the use of an algorithm that compares each word from an Arabic input with an internal codeword library that will then select the shortest codeword possible for single character and two-character combinations to replace the default Unicode representation, which also serves as a space saving method that allows longer messages to be encoded in a single QR Code. In return, the same method is also used to properly decode the message.},

However, many important applications such as those related with accessibility technologies or robotics, depends on first detecting the presence of a barcode in an environment. We employ Viola-Jones rapid object detection framework to address the problem of finding QR codes in arbitrarily acquired images. This framework provides an efficient way to focus the detection process in promising regions of the image and a very fast feature calculation approach for pattern classification. An extensive study of variations in the parameters of the framework for detecting finder patterns, present in three corners of every QR code, was carried out. Detection accuracy superior to 90\%, with controlled number of false positives, is achieved. We also propose a post-processing algorithm that aggregates the results of the first step and decides if the detected finder patterns are part of QR code symbols. This two-step processing is done in real time.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, with the developing of the computer science, computer vision is widely used in many areas. It is still a major problem about feature recognition in complex background and uneven intensity of light environment. Some researchers have already achieved in particular conditions. With the robot stepping into family, it is necessary to conduct in-depth study about feature recognition and access to information in complex indoor environmental conditions. In this paper, we present a fast identification approach for QR code in the indoor environment with normal light intensity. In the process of image feature recognition, it is very difficult for the edge while recognizing the slope image. Therefore, we use vector method to express the color characteristics in the image, and use the square minimum method to determine the edge lines of the pattern. In addition, linear scale transformation makes the image pattern more suitable for standard grids, which can correct the tiny sampling error. Besides, in the experiment of emulation process, we add a colored periphery features to positioning the image. It can be captured clearly due to the special colored background and behave well in the distance of 0.5m to 2m. Using an 860-pixel distance camera, the QR code pattern can be captured easily and identified effectively. A feedback control planar mobile robot is used as a platform to verify the identification method. After the robot heading to the front of the QR code pattern about 0.5m, the data of the sample image can be scanned and read accurately. The experiment results show that the approach is feasible and effective.},

Barcodes are often intended for consumer use where using a cellphone, a consumer can take an image of a barcode on a product, and retrieve relevant information about the product. The barcode must be read using computer vision techniques. While a color barcode can hold more information, it makes this vision task in consumer scenarios unusually challenging. We present our approach to the localization and segmentation of a 2D color barcode in such challenging scenarios, along with its evaluation on a diverse collection of images of Microsoft's recently launched high capacity color barcode (HCCB).

As the notion of ubiquitous computing has permeated, developing a new 2D-barcode and its applications has been a growing trend worldwide. A 2D-barcode symbol consists of two broad areas: data area and guide area. The components of the latter is collectively called "finder pattern" and used in locating the 2D-barcode symbol. The failure of finding the target symbol prevents a barcode reader from successfully decoding the barcode. Hence, designing a functional finder pattern is one of the key for improving the robustness of barcode reading, and thus, the entire 2D-barcode system. We have designed a novel finder pattern integrated with a color 2D-barcode for camera mobile phone applications. Through the development and evaluation of the finder pattern for effective color 2D-barcode detection, this paper discusses keys to improve the functionality and reliability of finder patterns, which should be kept in mind when designing a finder pattern for any 2D-barcode symbol.},

	abstract = {Two dimensional (2D) barcodes are becoming a pervasive interface for mobile devices, such as camera smart phones. Often, only monochrome 2D-barcodes are used due to their robustness in an uncontrolled operating environment of smart phones. Nonetheless, we are seeing an emerging use of color 2D-barcodes for camera smart phones. Most smart phones capture and store such 2D-barcode images in the baseline JPEG format. As a lossy compression technique, JPEG does introduce a fair amount of error in the captured 2D-barcode images. In this paper, we analyzed the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficient distributions of generalized 2D-barcodes using colored data cells, each comprising of 4, 8 and 10 colors. Using these DCT distributions, we improved the JPEG compression of such mobile barcode images. By altering the JPEG compression parameters based on the DCT coefficient distribution of the barcode images, our improved compression scheme produces JPEG images with higher PSNR value as compared to the baseline implementation. We have also applied our improved scheme to a 10 colors 2D-barcode system; and analyzed its performance in comparison to the default and alternative JPEG schemes. We have found that our improved scheme does provide a marked improvement for the successful decoding of the 10 colors 2D-barcode system.},

A number of common problems are encountered in the process of scanning and decoding barcode, such as various types of noise, blur, uneven lighting, and in particular the presence of extraneous information surrounding the image. In this paper we introduce a new 2D barcode namely HoloBarcode. The proposed barcode is developed as a computer generated hologram (CGH). Exploiting the ownerships of the holography, this new 2D barcode is able to provide the embedded information even in the presence of damaged surface. In particular, HoloBarcode is particularly robust in presence of extraneous information overlapping the image. For these reasons, this new barcode can be a valid alternative in all those applications where we have possibility of "important" damages of the code itself. Measurements of robustness to such manipulations were made, on 2D HoloBarcode against the popular Data Matrix code. Comparisons between the two different 2D Barcodes are highlighted.},

Barcode, which is simple but contains much information, has been used in navigation, manufacture and other situations by robots. Reading a barcode based on image analysis is an essential technique for such a robot system. Unfortunately, few existing image analysis methods about it are capable of identifying the codes under uncertain conditions, such as varying illumination, different sizes or orientations. This paper presents a method which can locate barcode region at an uncertain 3-D background through hierarchically extracting the distinct features of it with a high precision even for the broken, aberrant, partly blotted out stripes and other poor qualities of images. The method begins with a barcode quality assessment, in which a set of omnidirectional scan lines (active set lines) and a set of description of the whole image (resembling barcode measure), are defined. According to RBM, a series of corresponding methods are chosen to have a pre-processing process of the image and decode the codes respectively. The experiment results prove that our proposed method has two main characteristics. One is fast to locate barcode (get ROI of barcode). The other is to read barcode under unpredicted conditions robustly},

Based on the theory of pattern encoding method of visual two-dimensional barcode, pattern encoding-oriented error diffusion is proposed to improve the barcode visual quality. In order to increase the barcode capacity, central region visual two-dimensional barcode is designed and generated according to the human visual selective attention mechanism. The barcode is composed of center encoding area and surrounding encoding area. Experimental results show that the generated barcode not only has better visual quality, but also has larger capacity. More importantly, it can be used to identify Authentication.},

Barcode decoding systems usually fail to decode barcodes from an image that is affected by image blurring. With macro function, users are able to capture sharp barcodes. Unfortunately, low end and mid range cameras usually do not have macro function which enables close range image capturing. To improve barcode recognition, we propose a technique to restore barcode images before the decoding process. First, we identify and calculate the point spread function (PSF) parameter and radius of the blur in Cepstrum domain. Then we restore the degraded image using Wiener filter. Experiments on both synthetic and real images show that our technique is adept in estimating the radius of the blur. The Wiener filter gives satisfactory result when it is used to restore blurred images with the acquired PSF from the preceding step.},

Here we choose a specific problem in which the image is a barcode and the motion can be modeled as a convolution. We design a blind deconvolution algorithm to remove the translatory motion from a blurred barcode image. Based on the bimodal characteristics of barcode image histograms, we construct a simple target function that measures how similar a deconvoluted image is to a barcode. We minimize this target function over the set of possible convolution kernels to find the most likely blurring kernel. By restricting our search to dome-shaped kernels (first monotonously increasing and then monotonously decreasing) we decrease the number of false solutions. We have tried our system on a collection of a 138 barcode images with varying camera blur, and the recognition rate increases from 32\% to 65\%.},

However, depending on the combination of the target paper media, the ink used in the media, and the invisible ink, we cannot always correctly decode the information. In this paper, we introduce a new 2D barcode encoding and decoding method which overcomes such problems. In our method, we divide the 2D code data area into several blocks, and do not use for encoding the blocks where many of the bits in the block have high probabilities of bit errors. The decoder determines the skipped blocks from the image itself.

	abstract = {The RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) is considered as one of the most preferable ways for the position estimation in indoor environments, since GPS does not work in such situations. In RFID system, an RFID reader enables to estimate the position of RFID tags easily and inexpensively. In applications with the position estimation of RFID tags, indoor robot navigations are very important for human society. The problem is how to obtain the position estimations of RFID tags as accurately as possible. Previously S-CRR (Swift Communication Range Recognition) has been proposed for the appropriate estimation method of this kind of applications. This method is capable of the accurate position estimation of an RFID tag in very short time. The disadvantage of S-CRR is that the mobile robot must stop to search RFID tags accurately at each position. In indoor robot navigations, mobile entities like robots have to move continuously because they need to navigate smoothly and safely. In this paper, we propose a new position estimation method of RFID tags with continuous moving only using RFID technology. We call this Continuous Moving CRR (CM-CRR). CM-CRR uses two communication ranges, long and short ranges and switches them appropriately. The system estimates the position of RFID tags using their approaches and continuous moving. To show the effectiveness of CM-CRR, we evaluate the estimation error of an RFID tag by computer simulations. From the results, CM-CRR can accurately estimate the position of RFID tags with continuously moving of the mobile robot and be applied to indoor robot navigations.},

	abstract = {Technology-driven transactions, or e-commerce, should not involve a tradeoff in which consumers relinquish widening amounts of their privacy in return for greater convenience. Businesses that put customers in control of their online privacy options increase consumer faith in the online world - and promote greater acceptance of e-commerce. Ultimately, though, the issue comes down to consumer empowerment and trust. ``Companies rolling out RFID must have a clear and rigidly enforced policy on the deactivation of their tracking mechanisms, as having a cost-effective supply chain will be pretty meaningless if nobody trusts you enough to buy from you,'' states Martin Butler. RFID is rapidly pushed to the existing markets with diversified applications, such as automatic tariffs payment in public transport, animal identification and tracking, and automated manufacturing and logistics control. Unprotected communications between tags and readers over a wireless channel can disclose information about the tags and their positions. Due to the potential wide deployment of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), the security of RFID systems has drawn extensive attention from both academia and industry, and the RFID authentication protocol is an important mechanism in the security of RFID systems. The desired security requirements of RFID authentication protocols include privacy, integrity, authentication, anonymity/untraceability, and even availability. To design an efficient protocol that satisfies all the requirements with limited resources is a challenge According to Benoit Calmels et.al - 2006 -Strong cryptography mechanisms need high computing resources which is not possible to be embedded into RFID tags. The approach would be an implementation of some low -cost but secure cryptographic functions in the tag. It would bring a high level of privacy where there is no need for any substantial change in the synopsis of communication between the tag and the reader. On - - the other hand, the tag broadcasts the same data to any reader, with dependency on given authorization, could read and process all or part of the said data. The major challenge faced when trying to provide security for low-cost radio frequency identification (RFID) tags in their very limited resources- for example, tag memory will be restricted to several hundred bits, and approximately 250-4000 logic gates out of the total tag space can be devoted to security- related tasks. So readers should bear in mind that these constrained devices are unable to support on-chip standard cryptographic primitives. During this research with an exploratory purpose some different protocols around authentication and cryptography in low cost RFID would be investigated and compared as the output and result with a qualitative approach. This strategy makes the opportunity to discover similarities and differences among protocols and solutions. So that specialists or executives who are looking for a proper protocol or scheme correspondent to their needs or priorities, could choose one or two among others, in other words when investigating the varied types of attacks against schemes, the administrator or the customer of the technology (technology buyer) could set up a comparison to find the suitable protocol according to his /her criterions or priorities like the value of data that is going to be transmitted by RFID transceivers in the air field or wireless media, or the probable attacks could happen according to situation of located RFID devices. For example, if the administrator or executive knows that the position or location that his/her RFID devices located are vulnerable to DOS attack would not choose RHLK or LCAP as the appropriate protocol, or if he/she assumes that spoofing or replay attack is more probable than other attacks then would not choose Li et al. or SRAC schemes for his/ her RFID transceivers authentication.},

	abstract = {Radio frequency identification (RFID) strap attachment modality is more reliable, low cost, and easy to assemble, and therefore, it becomes increasingly more popular in RFID tag designs. This paper presents a single-ended probe method with power transmission coefficient compensation for the characterization of RFID straps. Approximate identification of the read/write threshold power and impedance is based on the charge status of voltage multipliers and charge pumps instead of on the read/write-modulated commands. For comparison purposes, the conventional source-pull system is also briefly reviewed and applied to verify the measurement results of absorbing power and impedance of RFID straps using the presented method. An enhanced source-pull system, named RFID source-pull system, for an RFID strap that can accurately measure the threshold power and impedance for read/write-modulated commands is also constructed for verifying the presented method. Alien and Texas Instruments (TI) straps are used for measurement examples in this paper. It is found that the measurement results of both RFID straps obtained by the presented method agree well with those by the conventional source-pull system and the RFID source-pull system. The single-ended probe method can measure the approximate read/write threshold power and impedance of the RFID strap with minimum operating procedures; furthermore, the complicated radio frequency (RF) facilities are not required. Obtaining the read/write threshold power and impedance of RFID straps allows designers to estimate the maximum read range of the designed RFID tag in advance. Therefore, the implemented cost and design cycle times can substantially be reduced.},

The technology for radio frequency identification (RFID) enables data to be transmitted by a tiny portable device, called a tag, which is read by an RFID reader and processed according to the needs of a particular application. It is only recently that the technology has begun to take off in the mass market. RFID applications in mobile phone business have not yet been deployed in other that small scale, but the discussion around this topic has been really started. Analysts predict that RFID will revolutionize areas of industry, such as supply chain management and the retail business, for example by reducing costs with better stock management. As the components for RFID-systems - tags and readers - have become smaller and cheaper, the technology has begun to take-off, in a variety of different areas This paper focuses on the applications of RFID technology in mobile telecommunication services. Many experts see RFID as an enabler for ubiquitous computing - the integration of computation into the environment: any device, anytime, anywhere. Reservation could be as simple as holding your phone close (less than 20 centimeters) to a poster or advertising billboard. RFID enabled mobile phones could be a first step in this direction. The combination of mobile phones and RFID technologies promises great potential in the market for mobile telecommunication services, which is discussed in this paper.},

	abstract = {Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology has been widely used in passive RFID localisation application due to its flexible deployment and low-cost. But current passive RFID localisation systems cannot achieve both highly accurate and precise moving object localisation task owing to tag collisions and variation of the behavior of tags. Most researchers increase the density of tag distribution to improve localisation accuracy, and then consider using either anti-collision process embedded in the hardware of the RFID reader or advanced localisation algorithms to enhance localisation precision. However, advanced anti-collision processes for RFID devices are challenged by the physical constraint characteristics of radio frequency; and improved localisation algorithm cannot fundamentally reduce the impacts of tag collision on localisation precision. This research work attempts to improve localisation precision of a passive RFID localisation system by using sparsely distributed RFID tags. This paper first defines a measure for accuracy and precision in a passive RFID localisation system with regard to RFID Tag Distribution. An exponential based function is then derived from experimental measurements, which reflects the relationship between RFID Tag Distribution and localisation precision. This function shows that localisation precision is mainly determined by tag density of RFID Tag Distribution. Based on the experimental findings, a sparse RFID Tag Distribution approach is proposed. The results show that in comparison with the conventional RFID Tag Distribution; passive RFID localisation system with sparse RFID Tag Distribution can deliver a higher localisation precision for the required accuracy.},

	abstract = {Radio frequency identification (RFID) is an automatic identification technology which identifies physical objects individually according to their unique identifiers (ID) recorded in each RFID tag. Many business processes require the integrity verification of a group of objects in addition to individual object identification. This paper proposes ``group coding'' of RFID tags with which we can verify the integrity of groups of objects by writing parity check data to the memory of RFID tags. It was revealed by simulations and experiments that we could determine the number of missing RFID tags up to 10 with accuracy over 99\% when we write 96 bits of the checksum data to 20 RFID tags. The whole duration of group decoding measured in the experiment was approximately 2 to 3 s. The time to compute group encoding and decoding was in the order of several milliseconds and thus negligible. The RFID inventory accounts for the majority of the duration. Note to Practitioners-Current RFID features fast identification of many physical objects. However, the integrity check of a group of objects is usually done by looking up a packaging list or a shipment list in EDI, which requires a network connection. Our proposed ``group coding'' of RFID tags can perform the group integrity check without a network connection. In addition, when the integrity of the group is infringed, the group coding can determine the number of RFID tags missing from the group. These features of group coding can reduce the cost of looking up shipment lists and locate missing RFID tags. The accuracy of the determination is controlled by adjusting the size of data written in each RFID tag. Adopters of group coding can select the optimal performance of group coding from the requirements of the accuracy and constraints like memory consumption of RFID tags.},

Most of the RFID networks include a wide range of automation technologies. These technologies are RFID readers, RFID writers, RFID barcode scanners, RFID smart sensors and RFID controllers. In this study, a solution has been provided for the problems encountered in parking-lot management systems via RFID technology. RFID readers, RFID labels, computers, barriers and software are used as for the main components of the RFID technology. The software has been handled for the management, controlling, transaction reporting and operation tasks for parking lots located on various parts of the city. Check-ins and check-outs of the parking-lots will be under control with RFID readers, labels and barriers. Personnel costs will be reduced considerably using this technology. It will be possible to see unmanned, secure, automized parking-lots functioning with RFID technology in the future. Check-ins and check-outs will be handled in a fast manner without having to stop the cars so that traffic jam problem will be avoided during these processes. Drivers will not have to stop at the circulation points and parking tickets will be out of usage during check-ins and check-outs. It will be avoided ticket-jamming problems for the ticket processing machines as well. Vehicle owners will not have to make any payments at each check-out thus a faster traffic flow will be possible. Since there won't be any waiting during check-ins and check-outs the formation of emission gas as a result of such waiting will be avoided. An automized income tracking system, a car tracking system for charging and a central parking-car tracking system have been developed and utilized. Instead of cars' parking on streets, a more modern and a fast operating parking-lot system have been developed.},

The existing inventory models - commonly used for reordering the products by the retailer - have been well studied for non-RFID implementations. In this paper, we modify these models to consider RFID implementations. The problem we address in this paper is how RFID implementations can affect the production models. RFID implementations incur additional costs, which is a disadvantage for organizations involved in the supply chain. However, the advantage of RFID is that it can make the supply chain continuously visible thus reducing the production lead times to zero or almost negligible. The key question we address is, if RFID technology is implemented, should the organization move to a different production model to reap the benefits of RFID implementations? This paper discusses the conditions under which an RFID implementation is beneficial compared to a non-RFID implementation for existing inventory models. We argue that, in most cases, changes to an organization's inventory model is required for an RFID implementation to be beneficial. We present detailed mathematical expressions and illustrate them with examples to support our claims.},

However the bicycle industries currently have no effective management methods, including production management, theft and sale certification, so that bicycle-related industries are seeking to solve their problems by using RFID. RFID is a non-contact automatic identification technology; mainly it is composed by the identification code embedded in a chip and antenna to receive the data. Because bicycles are made of metal materials or advanced carbon fiber materials, all these materials will affect electromagnetic waves. And also, the bicycle production processes are subject to a lot of high temperature paint treatment. The Tags are also buried in the body for future identification after sale. Currently the bicycle industry prefers putting RFID tags under not easily noticed place. The only place is under the seat location packaged with RFID where LF combined with the special antenna and tag reader is used to successfully read and solve the problem of bicycle production and certification. However, the problem how to solve theft? RFID tags built with a memory can be entered with personal information, bicycle information, and so. The current RFID technology indeed can be applied in this context, and even the whole plate was proposed to be used with RFID to carry out the vehicles supervision, traffic management, anti-theft applications. However the privacy creates the greatest resistance because people do not want their whereabouts being traced. Integrated with GPS and GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), RFID is used for personal management. The problem of insufficient power supply will be solved by integrating with solar panels. Finally, the very light weight characteristics of UHF will be applied to the competition of human sports. RFID operation principles are: 1) Reader emits radio frequency signal when the RFID tag gets into the read range. 2) The energy obtained by induced- - current is used to send identification code, or reader takes the initiative to send the signal. 3) After reader reads the message, the message is decodes and then sent to application system to process for query, track, or statistical purposes. RFID applications cover in a wide range, most of which are vehicle access control, logistics management, container management, transportation fee system, automatic control and stored value cards. By using RFID characteristics such accessing a large data capacity, high portability, confidentiality and etc.. This paper implements a bicycle management system for anti-theft, certification, and competition to assist bicycle industry production and after-sales service. The RFID system integrated with image capture technology is used by the relevant industry for athletic competition to replace the manual record, and manage their time and personal safety for sports programs. UHF tags with almost no weight placed on athlete body during competition are integrated with cameras, GPS systems, and the 3G network to obtain the real-time game data. It can be applied to the competitions such as bicycling, walking and climbing to ensure real-time monitoring and the safety of athletes.},

	abstract = {RFID has been a popular technology in the areas of supply-chain management, asset tracking, and manufacturing. In general, research related to RFID's potential contributions fall under technological, applications-related, or policy and security issues. However, there's little discussion in the extant literature on the environmentally responsible management of RFID. Traditionally, information and communications technologies (ICT) have been viewed as having a negative impact on the environment, and RFID, as part of ICT, has earned a similar reputation. RFID is also one of the main technologies of pervasive computing, which consumes enough energy to negatively impact the environment. Furthermore, some experience has suggested that we need to take precautionary measures to prevent the likely negative results from the final disposal of RFID labels. Currently, RFID tags are neither biodegradable nor recyclable. Nonetheless, RFID could indeed be a part of green IT, not only by adding economic value to organizations but also by improving environmentally responsible practices related to IT-for example, by accurately tracking a perishable item and preventing its spoilage, RFID can save energy in operations ranging from growing and harvesting to packaging and refrigeration. To explore RFID's potential in green IT, we reviewed 13 case studies, evaluating RFID's contribution to green objectives.},

	abstract = {A major component of a mobile robot system is the ability to navigate accurately in unknown environments with little or no human intervention. In this paper, we present a modular and cost-effective navigation technique incorporating signals from RFID tags, an RFID reader, and a fuzzy logic controller (FLC). The RFID tags are placed at 3-dimensional positions in the robot's workspace in such a way that the lines linking their projection points on the ground define "free-ways" along which the robot is desired to navigate. The RFID reader is mounted on the mobile robot to communicate with the RFID tags to determine the robot's position. The FLC is then applied to guide the robot along a pre-defined trajectory in an unknown working environment. For this purpose, we introduce two minor changes to the RFID tag architecture while keeping that of the RFID reader unchanged. A simplistic circuit and a primitive microcontroller are added to the RFID tag to compute the signal's power received by the tag and encode it within the tag ID, respectively. This way, virtually any commercially available RFID reader can be used without the need for any special customization. The performance of the proposed navigation scheme is evaluated through several numerical simulations.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a sequential image stitching approach for creating high-quality panoramic images on mobile devices. In this approach, each source image in the image sequence is stitched onto the panoramic image sequentially using two operations: optimal seam finding and transition smoothing. In the seam finding process, graph cut optimization finds an optimal seam and creates labeling in the overlapping area between the current panoramic image and the current source image. The current panoramic image can be updated by merging the current source image using the labeling information. If there are visible stitching artifacts in the seam, a transition smoothing operation is performed to hide the seam and remove the stitching artifacts. In the transition smoothing process, a gradient vector field is created from the gradients of corresponding pixels in the current labeled source image to construct a Poisson equation. A composite image can be recovered from the gradient vector field by solving the Poisson equation with boundary conditions. The current panoramic image is updated by merging the composite image. The approach presents several advantages. The use of graph cut optimization guarantees finding optimal seams and avoids blurring and ghosting problems caused by objects moving between capture of input images or by spatial alignment errors. The gradient domain transition smoothing process reduces color differences and further improves image quality. The sequential panorama stitching procedure enables us to produce high resolution panoramic images with limited memory resources. The approach is implemented and it produces high quality panoramic images on mobile devices. It shows good performance for both indoor and outdoor scenes.},

Also, when stitching the images in the indoor environment, the distance between the scene and camera is closer than that in the outdoor air reconnaissance mission. The motion parallax easily exists in the continuously captured image sequence. The hierarchical image stitching method with the dominant image selection for a same scene is proposed to reduce the motion parallax region in the mosaic image.

Existing deblurring methods assume spatial-invarint blur kernel, pixelwise constant blur kernel or planar camera motion. But these assumptions are difficult to hold in the real blurred image which is a spatial-variant blurred image by 3D camera motion. To overcome such limits for stitching blurred image, in this paper, we present a new feature based framework of stitching a clear/blurred image pair. It is inspired by recently proposed projetive warping models depicting the camera movement embedded in the capturing process of the blurred image.

The image stitching process will be carried out in certain intermediate nodes along the way towards a centralized decoder. This will help to conserve more power since the amount of data to be transmitted is reduced. In addition, the tree structure adapted by SPIHT is modified to improve the flexibility in coding the stitched image.

	abstract = {Camber is one of the most important defects in the endless hot-rolling process, and can be defined as the longitudinal curvature of a slab or strip in the plan view. To obtain a value of the camber for a steel bar, the overall shape of a slab or strip is required. However, the strip is too long to capture overall image at once. In order to obtain precise information on the overall shape of the bar, two area-scan charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras to obtain partial bar images and the image stitching algorithm are needed. This paper proposes a fast algorithm to obtain the overall shape of a steel bar in the endless hot rolling process. The proposed algorithm reduces the computational complexity and the running time of the image stitching process by adaptively selecting the search region to find feature points in steel bar images. The algorithm consists of three parts: generating the feature points and descriptors of the selected regions of continuous images for the steel bar, choosing the overlapped region between the present image and the next image, and stitching the partial bar images after calibrating them. The proposed stitching algorithm based on adaptive selection of the search region improves the performance of the camber measurement system during the image stitching process.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new algorithm for Image Registration and Stitching. The algorithm is designed to be extremely efficient and fast in its execution and is intended for use in stitching images extracted from a video stream of a camera. This algorithm is not universally applicable to all the image registration and stitching problems. It is customized to be used to generate single images of surfaces such as a conveyor belt or undercarriage of vehicles, which cannot be captured by a single photo. The algorithm works by extracting edges of the two images to be registered. Then it selects a reference section from the first image and search in the second image where it finds the best match for that section. The best match is the east difference score. The section in the second image which gives the least difference score is then identified as the registration point between the two images. The speed of the algorithm is improved by using heuristics to restrict the search space in the second image. We present full details of how the extraction of the heuristic is done from the inputs and how it drastically reduces the execution time of the algorithm. The paper also contains a full section on comparing our algorithm with a set of existing algorithms. Our algorithm outperforms the existing ones for all the common image sizes.},

Our new approach is based on structure deformation and propagation for achieving the overall consistency in image structure and intensity. The new stitching algorithm, which has found applications in image compositing, image blending, and intensity correction, consists of the following main processes. Depending on the compatibility and distinctiveness of the 2D features detected in the image plane, single or double optimal partitions are computed subject to the constraints of intensity coherence and structure continuity. Afterwards, specific 1D features are detected along the computed optimal partitions from which a set of sparse deformation vectors is derived to encode 1D feature matching between the partitions. These sparse deformation cues are robustly propagated into the input images by solving the associated minimization problem in gradient domain, thus providing a uniform framework for the simultaneous alignment of image structure and intensity. We present results in general image compositing and blending in order to show the effectiveness of our method in producing seamless stitching results from complex input images.},

	abstract = {Image stitching techniques are widely used to integrate multi-view or sequential images into one image. But visible seams, blurring, or ghosting effects may occur in the overlapping regions for real image stitching. One approach to solve this problem is to find some kinds of seams in regions where the images agree, and then a weighted or blended integrating can be carried out around the pixels on the seams, which makes the transitions from one image to the other not visible. The traditional dynamic programming based method is proved to be effective to find such optimal seam but has an obvious drawback that its searching direction is restricted, so that it is not suitable to find an optimal seam connecting two specified points which is often required for sequential image stitching. Facing the above problem, a new optimal seam definition based on minimum cost is given, and then an optimal seam selection method based on enhanced dynamic programming is proposed in this paper. The analysis and visual results of our experiments using some real airborne sequential images show that, the approach proposed in this paper can handle significant structure misalignment and eliminates structure seam for the global seamless image stitching.},

The proposed criterion can be considered as a direct view condition for image stitching , i.e., it is desirable that each part of the composite image looks like its corresponding input image. More specifically, we do not use an explicit modeling of a compositing surface, but, we focus on the differential properties of a warping function. That is we design a cost function so that the Jacobian matrix of a warping function is close to a shape preserving matrix such as rotation and reflection matrices. The proposed cost function can be effectively minimized by using Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.

In this method, the whole image registration process has five steps, which includes feature point detection, feature descriptor extraction, feature points matching, estimation of the motion model parameters and stitching process. In these steps, difference of Gaussian image is used to get the extreme points as the feature points, then the SIFT descriptor operator is used to describe the feature, finally random sample consensus method is used for estimating the motion parameters. We test our method on two kinds of sequence images, the artificial images and the real images. The results show the stitching method is robust.},

And it uses a method based on invariant features to realize fully automatic image stitching, in which it includes two main parts: image matching and image blending. As the noises images have large differences between the other images, when using SIFT features to realize correct and robust matching, it supplies a probabilistic model to verify the panorama image sequence. Addison to have a more satisfied panorama image, it uses a simple and fast blending method which is weighted average method. Finally, the experiment results confirm the feasibility of our methods.},

	abstract = {Many different automatic color correction approaches have been proposed by different research communities in the past decade. However, these approaches are seldom compared, so their relative performance and applicability are unclear. For multi-view image and video stitching applications, an ideal color correction approach should be effective at transferring the color palette of the source image to the target image, and meanwhile be able to extend the transferred color from the overlapped area to the full target image without creating visual artifacts. In this paper we evaluate the performance of color correction approaches for automatic multi-view image and video stitching. We consider nine color correction algorithms from the literature applied to 40 synthetic image pairs and 30 real mosaic image pairs selected from different applications. Experimental results show that both parametric and non-parametric approaches have members that are effective at transferring colors, while parametric approaches are generally better than non-parametric approaches in extendability.},

In this paper, we propose an intuitive technique according to a stitching line based on a novel energy map which is essentially a combination of gradient map which indicates the presence of structures and prominence map which determines the attractiveness of a region. We consider a region is of significance only if it is both structural and attractive. Using this improved energy map, the stitching line can easily skirt around the moving objects or salient parts based on the philosophy that human eyes mostly notice only the salient features of an image. We compare result of our method to those of 4 state-of-the-art image stitching methods and it turns out that our method outperforms the 4 methods in removing ghosting artifacts.},

In general, the stitched image obtained by optimal seam finding can avoid the ghost effects but sometimes experience the unconformity of the image structure and color differences near the transition region between images. To solve these problems, the proposed algorithm adopts the seam carving/inserting operator and exploits an adaptive color blending algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can produce a stitched image without visible artifacts including the ghost effects, the unconformity of the structure, and the visible color differences. With respect to the visual quality of the stitched images, the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms simple conventional stitching algorithms and is comparable to the computationally demanding Poisson image editing algorithm1.},

This paper proposes a approach to stitch images fast and with high quality.Image alignment algorithms can discover the correspondence relationships among images with varying degrees of overlap. In this process, they uses SIFT to look for the trait points, and uses RANSAC to delete the wrong points. Image stitching algorithms take the alignment estimates produced by such registration algorithms and blend the images in a seamless manner by a kind searching method, which can deal with potential problems such as blurring or ghosting caused by parallax and scene movement as well as varying image exposures. Several real alignment images stitching experiments are carried out. The experimental results show that the algorithm can improve stitching visual quality obviously with acceptable computing cost.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an algorithm for eliminating the blurred image regions during image stitching. Since the camera is close to the objects when capturing the images in the indoor environments, stitching the images in the indoor scenes easily generates the blurred ghosting region. Here the reasons of blurred region generations can be categorized into two kinds. First, the slight camera vibration may result in the whole images unclear over a short span of frames. These unclear frames can be filtered out by distinguishing the clearness of the edge images between different scales. The other reason for originating the blurred region is that several image frames contain the same scene from different views. There may exist the inconsistent structures and observations in these different views. The color blending is performed to let the seam between aligned images smooth, however, it also makes these inconsistent region blurred, which is called the ghosting effect. Here, an optimal seam selection algorithm is proposed by utilizing the A* search algorithm to find a segment path away from the inconsistent overlap region and then remove the ghosting effect. The experimental results validate that the proposed algorithm can obtain the mosaic image with good quality and clear resolution.},

This work presents the algorithm for the stitching of different overlapped high resolution views of the whole scene obtained from high magnification optical microscopes into a large radiometric balanced image through maximization of a cross-correlation function. To seamlessly blend and reduce the possibility of intensity and color mismatching of multiple source images in mosaicing, a radiometric calibration of the microscope optical system is employed. The algorithm was tested with grayscale and color images, and showed convincing and robust results in image stitching and blending.},

	abstract = {Various applications such as mosaicing and object insertion require stitching of image parts. The stitching quality is measured visually by the similarity of the stitched image to each of the input images, and by the visibility of the seam between the stitched images. In order to define and get the best possible stitching, we introduce several formal cost functions for the evaluation of the stitching quality. In these cost functions the similarity to the input images and the visibility of the seam are defined in the gradient domain, minimizing the disturbing edges along the seam. A good image stitching will optimize these cost functions, overcoming both photometric inconsistencies and geometric misalignments between the stitched images. We study the cost functions and compare their performance for different scenarios both theoretically and practically. Our approach is demonstrated in various applications including generation of panoramic images, object blending and removal of compression artifacts. Comparisons with existing methods show the benefits of optimizing the measures in the gradient domain.},
